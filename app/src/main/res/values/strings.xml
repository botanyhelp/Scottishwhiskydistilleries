The distillery is located on the eastern outskirts of Aberfeldy, on the southern bank of the upper Tay. The demand for barley as a basic foodstuff during World_War_I led to the distillery being closed from 1917 to 1919.[2] The Second_World_War also caused barley supplies to be cut, and the distillery was again forced to shut down for some of this period.[2] Supply to final markets was kept up by reducing the period whisky was laid up from 7 years to 3.[citation_needed] In 1972 the distillery was enlarged, and the old stills were replaced by four new steam heated stills.[2] In 1999, an Aberfeldy 12 Year Old Single Malt brand was introduced. In 2000, the Earl_of_Elgin opened \"Dewar\'s World of Whisky\" at the Aberfeldy Distillery: this is a centre for marketing the products and educating the public about the process of distillation and history of the Dewar\'s brand.[3] Aberfeldy is the largest malt whisky component of Dewar\'s Blended Whisky. <u> The distillery[edit] </u> Aberfeldy is situated in the centre of Scotland, some five miles east of Loch Tay and the town of Kenmore and about eight miles south of Loch Tummel. Aberfeldy relies on the fresh water stream Pitilie Burn, which runs alongside the distillery. Aberfeldy is the only distillery in Scotland to use these waters.[4] Aberfeldy uses only Scottish barley, yeast and water. The area is contains historical landmarks, such as Kenmore_Bridge. This was built by the 3rd Earl in 1774 and the view from it was the inspiration for Robert_Burns\'s poem on the chimney piece of the Kenmore Inn.[4] The distillery has two wash stills with a capacity of about 16,500 liter and two spirit stills with 15,000 liters.[5] With these capacities the Aberfeldy distillery lies in the middle of the range of pot still sizes. <u> Products[edit] </u> Aberfeldy 12 years old[6] Aberfeldy 21 years old[7] <u> Reviews and Accolades[edit] </u> International Spirit_ratings organizations and liquor review bodies generally have had divergent reactions to Aberfeldy whiskies. The San Francisco World spirits competition has awarded the Aberfeldy 12&#8211; and 21&#8211;year whiskies a series of impressive medals, with the 12&#8211;year winning three golds and three silvers between 2007 and 2012 and the 21&#8211;year winning three golds, a double gold, and two bronze medals over the same time frame.[8][9] By contrast, Wine Enthusiast rated both offerings in its 85&#8211;89 range, a relatively modest score, in 2008.[8] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Aberfeldy_website\n2. ^ a b c d Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

The distillery was founded in 1893 by John Morrison, who bought the land from the Duke of Fife[citation_needed] to produce whisky for Haig\'s after several springs on the southern slope of Knock Hill were discovered.[1] The site was also chosen for its proximity to the Knock Station on the Banff branch line of the Great_North_of_Scotland_Railway (GNSR) between Aberdeen and Elgin.[citation needed] Not only was the new location convenient to the railway but it was also within a few miles of a district noted both for its barley and inexhaustible source of excellent peat.[citation_needed] The distillery was built using local eye grey granite, with two steam heated stills.[1] The two pot_stills could turn out 2,500 gallons of spirit per week.[citation_needed] It was also the first malt distillery built for the Distillers Company Ltd. It started production in 1894 and remained in continuous operation until 1931, when it was forced to close for a few years due to the economic depression. Wartime restrictions on barley forced a second closure from 1940&#8211;1945.[2] After the war, with the distillery connected to the national grid, the steam powered engine, which had been used since the its founding, was retired in 1947.[citation_needed] Knockdhu was closed in 1983, and was sold to Inver House in 1988,[1] after which production resumed in February 1989. Various bottling ages are available the most popular being 12 years old, there is also an annual vintage bottled around 14 15 years old, a 16 year old (matured solely in second fill bourbon casks) and a 30 year old. Previously named Knockdhu after the distillery, the whisky was renamed anCnoc in 1994 to avoid confusion with Knockando.[3] Knockdhu Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky is currently bottled under the Gaelic name anCnoc meaning \"the hill\". <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

By 1886 the distillery produced 300,000 gallons of whisky per year, and employed 60 workers.[2] Production was halted in 1981, but resumed on a limited basis in 1989 and continued at a low level through late 1996, during the period when Ardbeg was owned by Hiram Walker.[citation_needed] The distillery was bought and reopened by Glenmorangie plc (owned by the French company LVMH) with production resuming on June 25, 1997 and full production resuming in 1998. The distillery was reopened by Ed Dodson in 1997 and handed over to Stuart Thomson, who managed it from 1997 to 2006. Michael \"Mickey\" Heads, an Islay native and former manager at Jura who had worked at Ardbeg years earlier, took over on March 12, 2007. The name is derived from the Scottish_Gaelic:\nrd Beag, meaning Little Height. <u> Bottlings[edit] </u> Detail on a bottle of Ardbeg Ardbeg whisky is considered to be among the peatiest in the world, with most expressions using malt with a phenol content of 55ppm.[3] There are several official bottlings. Major ones include:\n* Ten Years Old, 46% ABV, the main whisky in the range.[4]\n* Airigh Nam Beist, 46% ABV, distilled in 1990, the name means \"shelter of\nthe beast\".[5]\n* Blasda, 40% ABV, a \"lightly peated\" expression of Ardbeg that only has\n8ppm phenol count.[6]\n* Corryvreckan, 57.1% ABV, previously a Committee&#8211;only bottling, it is\nintended as a replacement for Airigh Nam Beist in the core range.[7]\n* Supernova, 58.9% ABV, \"heavily peated\" to over 100 ppm phenol count.[8]\n* Supernova SN2010, 60.1% ABV, \"heavily peated\" to over 100 ppm phenol\ncount and bottled at a stronger ABV than previous Supernova.[9]\n* Uigeadail, 54.2% ABV, matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Named\nafter the loch that provides the distillery with water, pronounced oog&#8211;a&#8211;\ndal.\n* Rollercoaster, 57.3% ABV, a vatting of the first ten production years\n(1997 2006) of Ardbeg under Glenmorangie\'s ownership. The name comes\nfrom the shape of the bar chart plotting the amounts of whisky from each\nof those years, which resembles a rollercoaster. Rollercoaster\ncommemorates the 10th anniversary of the Ardbeg Committee\'s formation.\n[10]\n* Alligator, 51.2% ABV, is aged in new, severely charred American white oak\nbarrels.[11]\n* Galileo, 49%, Limited edition, Distilled in 1999 and bottled in 2012. Its\nrelease was to commemorate an experiment in which a sample of crafted\nmolocules (Ardbeg spirit) was sent into space to test the effects of\nmicrogravity on whisky maturation.[12]\n* Ardbog, 52.1%, The 2013 Ardbeg Day special bottling, containing whisky\nmatured in ex&#8211;manzanilla sherry casks for at least 10 years.[13] Also there are Committee bottlings that are available to members of the Ardbeg Committee [14] that precede official bottlings. Independent bottlings are also available but are considerably rarer than similar bottlings from other distilleries. Ardbeg seldom release whiskies with age statements. Ardbeg often bottles its whisky at a higher alcohol by volume (abv) than the minimum 40%, and they no longer chill_filter their whisky. Both of these measures are thought to yield a more full&#8211;flavoured whisky. The process of lowering the alcohol content at bottling can dilute the flavour, and while chill filtration gives the whisky a clearer appearance at lower temperatures by removing fatty_acids, proteins and esters that can cluster together, the loss of these compounds can also result in a loss of flavour; in particular the esters can contribute a fruit&#8211;like fragrance. <u> Awards[edit] </u> Ardbeg\'s offerings have garnered an array of awards at international spirit ratings competitions. For example:\n* Jim_Murray\'s Whisky Bible 2008 awarded the Ten Years Old expression the\ntitle of 2008 World Whisky of the Year and Scotch Single_Malt of the\nYear.[15] The Ten Years Old also won a series of medals at the 2006&#8211;2012\nSan_Francisco_World_Spirits_Competition, winning two gold and six silver\nmedals over that stretch.[16]\n* Jim_Murray\'s Whisky Bible 2009 and Whisky Bible 2010 awarded the\nUigeadail expression the title of 2009 and 2010 World Whisky of the Year\nand Scotch Single Malt of the Year. The San Francisco World Spirits\nCompetition awarded the Uigeadail two double gold, three gold, and two\nsilver medals between 2006 and 2012.[17]\n* Ardbeg Galileo won the World\'s Best Single Malt Whisky in the 2013 World\nWhiskies_Awards.[18] <u> Production[edit] </u> The distillery output is quite big for a distillery with only two pot stills. The wash still has a capacity of about 18,000 liters and the spirit still of about 17,000 liters.[19] Both pot_stills are constricted at the intermediate piece. This increases the amount of reflux in the distillation process and leads to a smoother spirit. <u> Promotional activities[edit] </u> The Ardbeg Committee is the distillery\'s promotional fan_club. Its members are consulted on new products and receive special offers and invitations to special gatherings, tastings and events. Committee members are able purchase special, Committee&#8211;only bottlings of the whisky. Every summer the distillery takes part in the island\'s F le (Islay\'s festival of music and malt whisky) which includes a distillery programme.[20] On 2 June 2012, the distillery promoted a global \"Ardbeg Day\". Celebrating with the theme of \"Islay&#8211;limpics\", the event included parties around the world, and released a special bottling.[21] In 2011, 20 vials of Ardbeg spirit and wood particles were sent to the International_Space_Station to investigate their interaction.[22] They returned on 12 September 2014.[23] <u> Cultural references[edit] </u> Ardbeg inspired the Finnish composer of contemporary music, Osmo_Tapio , to write the symphonic_poem Ardbeg The Ultimate Piece For Orchestra (2003). The piece was awarded in the 1st International Uuno_Klami composition competition in 2004. An audio recording of this piece was made on 28 April 2011, and was not offered for sale until January 2014, here. In the 2005 film Constantine starring Keanu_Reeves, the title character John Constantine (Reeves) is seen drinking Ardbeg in his apartment while talking to Detective Dodson (Rachel_Weisz). In the BBC series Spooks, the character Harry_Pearce is seen on a number of occasions to be drinking Ardbeg. <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ \"Ardbeg_web_site\".

In 1955, two stills were added, with four more stills being added in 1974, thus by 1974 it incorporated eight stills.[2] [3] The distillery used to have its own maltings (ceased mid&#8211;1970s) and its own cooperage (ceased late 1980s) and until early 2001 used coal to fire the stills. Ardmore single malt is sold at 46% ABV, in bottles embossed with an image of a golden_eagle. Unlike many single malts, it is barrier, rather than chill, filtered.

In 1994 Arran Distillers was founded by Harold Currie, former director of Chivas with the intention of building a distillery on Arran.[1] During the construction of the distillery, a pair of Golden Eagles built their nest on a cliff near the distillery; since Golden Eagles are a protected species, construction of the distillery was temporarily halted. The distillery opened in 1995. There used to be about fifty distilleries on the island, but most of them were \"moonlight\" or illegal distilleries.[citation_needed] The most recent legally founded distillery on Arran, called \'Lagg\', closed in 1837.[1] Until recently a proportion of the casks were stored in the warehouses of Springbank, due to a lack of room in the distillery, and the legal impossibility of extending the current warehouses at the Arran distillery. However, the distillery now has a revolutionary storage warehouse, on site, that allows easier access to barrels. The distillery offers a cask purchase scheme which offers private individuals the opportunity to own their own cask of whisky, which can be stored on site at the distillery. The Arran Distillery is a patron of the World Burns Federation and as such has created a Robert Burns Single Malt and Robert Burns Blended Whisky in honour of Scotland\'s National Poet. They are the only whisky distillery to be able to use the image and signature of Robert Burns on their packaging. The whisky of Arran is mostly used to produce their Single Malt Whisky, but a small proportion also goes into the production of their range of blended whiskies : Lochranza Blend, Robert Burns Blend and Arran Gold Single Malt Whisky Cream Liqueur. The Arran Distillery is now owned by a group of private shareholders and the Managing Director is Euan Mitchell. 2010 saw the release of a 15th Anniversary bottling on the occasion of the Distillery Open Day on 3 July. Autumn 2010 also saw the release of the first official 14 year&#8211;old to be released by the Distillery. The first peated Arran Single Malt (called Machrie Moor) has been available since December 8, 2010. <u> See also[edit] </u>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Arran_distillery.\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

The name Auchentoshan is from Gaelic Achadh an Oisein (Scottish Gaelic pronunciation: ]) and translates as \"the field of the corner\".[4] The distillery is also known as \"Glasgow\'s Malt Whisky\" due to its close proximity to Glasgow and \"the breakfast whisky\" due to its sweet and delicate nature. [citation_needed] Auchentoshan is located at the foot of the Kilpatrick hills on the outskirts of Clydebank in West_Dunbartonshire near the Erskine_Bridge. It is one of six malt whisky distilleries in the Scottish_Lowlands[5] along with Bladnoch, Glenkinchie and recently Daftmill_Distillery, Annandale Distillery and Ailsa_Bay Distillery. <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Production\n* 3_Awards_and_reviews\n* 4_See_also\n* 5_References\no 5.1_Notes\no 5.2_Bibliography\n* 6_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> Auchentoshan was built in 1800.[6] After its foundation, it changed hands multiple times, and was bought by Eadie Cairns in 1969, who rebuilt it completely.[6] Cairns sold Auchentoshan to Morrison_Bowmore distillers in 1984. [6] Suntory invested in Morrison Bowmore in 1989. In 1994, they acquired 100% of its holdings. In May of 2014, [7]Beam Inc. and Suntory Holdings Limited merged to create Beam Suntory Inc, who are now the owners of Auchentoshan and other Morrison Bowmore holdings. <u> Production[edit] </u> Unusual for a Scottish distillery, Auchentoshan practices triple distillation. [8] Generally the final stage of Scotch whisky production involves distilling the fermented mash in two copper stills. In Auchentoshan, a third still (known as the \"Intermediate Still\") helps to gives a final spirit strength of 81% ABV (162 proof).[9] This triple distillation, in addition to an unpeated malt,[4] gives Auchentoshan a more delicate and sweet flavour than many Scotch whiskies. [citation_needed] Maturation is mainly in ex&#8211;bourbon barrels and ex&#8211;sherry butts, though some Auchentoshans will mature in French wine casks.[10] Special bottlings are released periodically, including the oldest, a 50 year old Auchentoshan distilled in 1957 and released in 2008.[11] The distillery has a visitor centre and conference facilities, both completed in 2005, and is open to the public for tours every day of the week. <u> Awards and reviews[edit] </u> Auchentoshan offerings have performed well at international spirit_ratings competitions. Its 16&#8211; and 18&#8211;year scotches received double gold medals at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[12][13] The Auchentoshan Three Wood expression won \"the best Scotch Whisky and Cigar Combination\" in the world when paired with the Bolivar Inmensas.[14] The Fermentation Tanks The copper pot_stills Barrels in Auchentoshan distillery <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ \"Auchentoshan_History_Timeline\".

It was established after Dorie\'s Well was discovered and found to have water similar to the water used by the Glen_Spey distillery, which was used by Justerini_&amp;_Brooks to produce malt whisky for their blends. The wells water was used to produce a test batch of whisky at Glen Spey distillery, and was approved, which led to the start of construction of the Auchroisk distillery at the site of the well in 1972 to produce whisky for the J&amp;B blend. Production started in 1974.[1][2] The distillery produced its first single malt in 1978.[3] The single malt was rebranded as \'The Singleton\' in 1986, as the name \'Auchroisk\' was perceived as too difficult for consumers outside of Scotland. The name changed back to Auchroisk in 2001, when a bottleing was released under the name \'Auchroisk 10 Year Old Flora &amp; Fauna\' in the Diageo Flora &amp; Fauna range. In 2008 the name was changed again, this time to \'The Singleton of Auchroisk\'.[1] The distillery is used as a hub for vatting Auchroisk with the highland whiskies used in J&amp;B before being shipped off for marrying and bottling.[3] Auchroisk, the name of the distillery, means shallow ford across the red stream in Gaelic, referring to the nearby Mulben Burn. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b \"Auchroisk_Single_Malt_Scotch_Whisky\". whiskymerchants.\n2. ^ \"Auchroisk\".

Its name is a derived from the phrase An t&#8211;Allt M Gaelic for big burn, referring to its water source the Auchinderran burn.[1] It was founded in 1895 by Alexander Edward, then owner of the Benrinnes distillery.[2] The distillery was originally powered by a waterwheel, and was soon adapted to use a steam engine instead,[1] which ran day and night for 70 years, apart from maintenance. During maintenance hours power was provided by the mainly retired waterwheel. The steam engine is now on display at the distillery site.[3] The distillery was expanded in 1898, and production doubled.[3] In 1899 the distillery was owned by Pattisons which went bankrupt in that year. Production plummeted,[2] and the distillery closed. Aultmore reopend around 1904, and closed again during World_War_I due to barley shortages[1] It reopened again after World War I ended, and was bought by John_Dewar_and sons in 1923.[2] Shortly thereafter, in 1925, it was bought by Distiller Company.[4] It changed hands again in 1930, when it was bought by Scottish Malt Distillers.[4] The distillery was in the 1950s one of the first to use the draff, a wasteproduct of whisky production, as animal feed.[1] The distilleries malting_floors closed in 1968 and the entire distillery was rebuilt and expanded in 1970. A new spirit_still and wash_still were placed in addition to the two stills that were already present, and Aultmore Reopened in 1971.[4] In 1998 the distillery was sold back to Bacardi subsidiary Dewars, which had previously owened Aultmore between 1923 and 1925.[4] Aultmore produced their first official bottling, a 12 year old, in 2004, after an earlier flora_and fauna release, and an earlier rare_malts release.[1] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d e Johannes van den Heuvel. \"Aultmore_distillery_profile\".\nmaltmadness.com.\n2. ^ a b c Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

Originally founded in 1790,[2] the distillery was rebuilt in 1895 by the designer Charles_C_Doig to be closer to the Edderton Railway Station on the Inverness_and_Ross&#8211;shire_Railway line. However, so good was the original water source that the rebuilt distillery chose to ignore a nearby burn in favour of the original Ault Dearg burn. To this day, the Balblair Distillery continues to use this original water source. John Ross, the founder, ran Balblair as a thriving business and in 1824 he was joined by his son, Andrew. The distillery stayed in the Ross family until 1894 when the tenancy was taken over by Alexander_Cowan. In 1948 the freehold was bought by Robert_Cumming, who promptly expanded the distillery and increased production. Cumming ran the distillery until he retired in 1970 when he sold it to Hiram_Walker. In 1996 Balblair Distillery was purchased by Inver_House Distillers_Limited. Balblair has one of the oldest archives in distilling, with the first ledger entry dated 25 January 1800. John Ross himself penned that first entry, which read:\nSale to David Kirkcaldy at Ardmore, one gallon of whisky at 1.8.0d Balblair Single Malt whisky is bottled in four vintages &#8211; 2000, 1997, 1989 and 1979 &#8211; with the design inspired by the nearby Pictish_stone Clach_Biorach, which is thought to be 4000 years old. The 1989 vintage won a Gold Medal and was judged \"best in class\" in the 2007 International Wine &amp; Spirits Competition, and was recommended by Ian Buxton in 101 Whiskies to Try Before You Die.[3] The distillery is now owned by Inver_House_Distillers_Limited, whose other distilleries include the_Speyburn&#8211;Glenlivet_Distillery, Knockdhu_Distillery, Old_Pulteney_Distillery and Balmenach_Distillery. <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Balblair_distillery_at_Whisky.com\n2. ^ \"Balblair_Distillery\".

[citation_needed] At seven he began herding cattle at a farm on the upper reaches of the River_Deveron.[citation_needed] He was apprenticed to a shoemaker then worked as a clerk, and then became a bookkeeper at Mortlach distillery 1866. There he was appointed as a clerk and then manager and learned the distilling trade. After about twenty years, Grant left his job at the Mortlach distillery and bought a field near Balvenie_Castle. He then drew up plans for his distillery and the foundation_stone was laid in the autumn of 1886. Grant remained active in the company until his death in 1923 at the age of 83. <u> Balvenie distillery[edit] </u> In early 1892 work began to convert an 18th&#8211;century mansion (Balvenie New House) into a distillery.[2] The building took fifteen months to complete and on 1 May 1893, the first distillation took place at the Balvenie Distillery. In 2007, The Balvenie\'s Global Brand Ambassador, David Mair presented an online documentary series about the making of malt whisky, shot in and around the Balvenie Distillery.[3] <u> Whiskies[edit] </u> Balvenie produces whisky in a traditional style.

A coastal distillery in the Western Highlands, Ben Nevis draws its water from the Allt Mhuilinn which originates from two pools, Coire Leis and Coire na Ciste. The distillery was founded in 1825 by \'Long John\' McDonald,[2] a 6 ft 4in descendant of a ruler of the western Scottish kingdom of Argyll (after whom the renowned blended Scotch, Long John, was named).

In a bid to keep up with growing demand, the two distilleries eventually became one in the early twentieth century. In 1955 the distillery was taken over by new proprietors with Joseph Hobbs in the driving seat.[2] Under Hobbs\'s ownership, the distillery joined the ranks of those experimenting with continuous distillation, installing a Coffey_Still which remained on the site for 26 years and made this distillery one of the first to produce malt and grain whisky simultaneously.[2] The Japanese company Nikka (Japan) acquired the distillery in 1989.[2] The heart of the range has been for some time the 10 years old. There have also been a few cask&#8211;finishes, limited editions and independent bottlings, notably from Blackadder and Douglas Laing. In 1991, a visitor centre and cafe was opened for the public. </string>

[3]Only BenRiachs maltings remained in active use, producing malt for Longmorn. It didn\'t produce spirit again until 1965 when it was reopened by Glenlivet Distillers Ltd.[3] In 1978 the distillery changed hands, this time to Seagrams.[3] Seagrams became part of Pernod Ricard in 2001 and the BenRiach distillery began operating for just three months of every year. In 2004 the distillery was acquired by an independent consortium, the BenRiach Distillery Company Limited.[4][5]\nIt was with delight, while sworn to secrecy, that I witnessed\nBenRiach gaining its independence, when a team led by the experienced\nand infectiously enthusiastic Billy Walker acquired the Distillery.\nThis independence will allow BenRiach to unlock its secrets and bring\nits fine and surprising malts, officially to the market in their\nnatural state for the first time.

It was founded in 1826, and is still active. The distillery employed a unique partial triple distillation process until 2007. <u> History[edit] </u> The first time whisky was produced at the site of Benrinnes distillery was in 1826, when a distillery was founded by Peter McKenzie.[1] This distillery was destroyed by a flood in 1829, and was rebuilt in 1835[2] in the outbuildings of a farmhouse[3] by John Innes, and officially founded under the name Lyne of Ruthrie[1] The distillery went bankrupt, and Lyne of Ruthrie was sold to William Smith. [when?] Smith changed the name of the distillery to the present name Benrinnes [1] before selling the property to David Edward[when?] who ran the distillery until his son Alexander Edward took over operation of the distillery.[when?][1] In 1887 Alfred_Barnard described the distillery in his work The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom. At this time the distillery had two stills, a wash still with a capacity of 1080 gallons, and a spirit still of 1004 gallons.[4] In 1896 the distillery was damaged in a fire. It was rebuilt and modernised; the distillery converted to be powered by electricity.[2] The distillery was sold to John_Dewar_&amp;_Sons in 1922.[1] Under Dewars it was rebuilt in 1955,[2] replacing the malting_floors with a Saladin_box, and ending the farming activities on the site.[3] The distillery was expanded in 1966, adding three stills to the three present stills, which were all converted to internal heating in 1970. In 1974 Benrinnes changed its distillation process to a partial triple distillation process.[2] The distillery stopped producing its own malt in 1984 opting to buy malt on the market instead, and removed its saladin box.[2] The triple distillation process was abandoned in 2007, when it switched to a more common configuration of two wash stills and four spirit stills.[2] <u> Production[edit] </u> Benrinnes employed some unusual production techniques. Between 1974 and 2007 the distillery used a unique partial triple distillation process. In this process the feints from the wash still, the weaker parts of feints of the spirit still, and the feints from the low wine still itself are distilled in a low_wines still, while the spirit still is fed by the foreshots and the heart of the wash and low wine still, and its own foreshots and strong feints. The necks of the stills are cooled by worm tubs, a technique that is no longer very common.[3] Benrinnes produces one fifteen&#8211;year&#8211;old semi&#8211;official bottling in the Flora_and Fauna_range since 1991.[2] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d e Helen Arthur (2002) [1997]. translation by: Lisbeth\nMachielsen, ed.

Brickmann founded the Benromach Distillery Company in 1898. Duncan MacCallum had previously been working at the Glen_Nevis_Distillery in Campbeltown and FW Brickmann was a spirit broker in Leith, Edinburgh. Construction work started at the site of Benromach Distillery in 1898 however due to the depression in the Scotch_Whisky industry in 1898 the distillery did not start producing whisky until 1900 but closed the same year due to a lack of money. In 1911 Benromach was acquired by the London based Harvey_McNair_&amp;_Co who continued distilling until the onset of the First_World_War. After the war Benromach was acquired by Benromach Distillery Ltd and was run by this new private company until 1925. In 1938 Benromach was acquired by Associated Scottish_Distilleries_Ltd which later became a part of Scottish_Malt_Distillers Ltd. Between 1966 and 1974 the distillery was modernised and continued to run until 1983 when the distillery was officially closed. In 1993 Gordon_and_MacPhail took over the site and in 1997 they started to restore the distillery to a working order. The design of the distillery was changed slightly to allow it to be operated by one man. Finally in 1998 the distillery was officially reopened by Charles,_Prince_of_Wales and bottling of the new malt started in 2004.

In 1878 the distillery was enlarged and modernised, presumably to cope with rising production. By 1887 the site occupied 2 acres (8,100 m2) with a further 50 acres (200,000 m2) being farmed by the proprietor, who was the son and nephew of the founders; the output had risen considerably to 51,000 imperial gallons (230,000 L) per annum. In 1887 the distillery was described, by John Barnard on his tour of distilleries, as:\n\"A square pile of buildings erected around a courtyard, with all the\nwater used in the works coming from a mill dam supplied from the upper\nreaches of the river; an overshot water wheel does all the driving power.\nThe Malting House is a mainly stone building 118 feet (36 m) by 28 feet\n(8.5 m) with a slated roof, the woodwork painted red; it has three\nfloors, the ground floor for malting and the top floors for barley, each\npossessing a stone step. There are besides, two other barns 95 feet\n(29 m) by 32 feet (9.8 m) similarly arranged. At left and right angles of\nthe court are the kilns each loaded by a hoist, floored with perforated\niron plates and heated with peats. On the top floor of the intermediate\nbuilding there is a Malt Deposit on a level with the kilns and underneath\nthere is the Mill andGrist Loft.\n\"Also within the quadrangle is the Mash House, 40 feet (12 m) square\ncontaining two Heating Coppers holding together 5,700 gallons and a Tun\n16 feet (4.9 m) in diameter and five and a half feet deep with stirring\ngear.

In the main courtyard is a small cooperage\nand cask shed.\" [2] During the 1890s \"misfortunes\" which are not specified struck the distilling industry; these could have been the reduction nation&#8211;wide in the production of barley, a possible rise in excise duty and the growth of the various temperance movements. The other distilleries in Galloway were forced to close but Bladnoch survived. Between 1911 and 1937 it was owned by Wm Dunville &amp; Co. Ltd, an Irish company, and on the outbreak of World_War_II whisky production ceased, but malt continued to be produced until 1949 when the distillery closed until 1957. Upon re&#8211;opening under new ownership whisky production began again and continued under a number of different owners until 1983 when Bell\'s took over and initiated a programme of modernisation and computerisation. In 1987 the United Distillers_Group took over Bell\'s and continued the modernisation as a result of which the weekly production rose to over 8,000 imperial gallons (36,000 more than eight times the output in 1887. The mothballed distillery was discovered by Irishman Raymond Armstrong while on holiday in the area in 1994. After several years spent finding and replacing the old plant and equipment, the distillery reopened for production in late 2000. The first 8&#8211;year&#8211;old product produced by the new team became available in 2009. The distillery recently went into administration and is currently (November 2014) awaiting new owners.

Morrison Bowmore also own the Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch distilleries and produce the McClelland\'s_Single_Malt range of bottlings.[1] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Production\n* 3_Products\n* 4_See_also\n* 5_References\n* 6_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> The Bowmore Distillery was established in 1779 by a local merchant, John P. Simpson, before passing into the ownership of the Mutter family, a family of German descent.[1] James Mutter, head of the family, also had farming interests and was Vice_Consul representing the Ottoman_Empire, Portugal, and Brazil through their Glasgow consulates.[1] There are no records that pinpoint the date Mutter acquired the distillery from Simpson. Mutter would introduce a number of innovative processes to the distillery during his tenure and even had a small iron steam_ship built to import barley and coal from the mainland and to export the whisky to Glasgow.[1] A bottle of 1850 Bowmore Single Malt was sold at an auction in September 2007 for\n29,400.[2] The distillery was bought from the Mutter family in 1925 by J.B. Sheriff &amp; Co. and remained under their ownership until being purchased by Inverness&#8211;based William Grigor &amp; Son, Ltd. in 1950.[1] During the World Wars the Bowmore Distillery halted production, and hosted the RAF_Coastal_Command for much of World_War_II, Coastal Command operated flying boats from Loch Indaal on Anti&#8211;submarine_warfare missions.[1] Stanley P. Morrison and James Howat formed Stanley P. Morrison Ltd. in 1951, and this company formed Morrison\'s Bowmore Distillery, Ltd. in 1963 in order to take over the Bowmore Distillery. Stanley P. Morrison died in 1971, and control of the companies passed to Brian Morrison.[1] The company name has changed slightly, and, following minor restructuring, the distillery is now owned by Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd., which is ultimately owned by the Japanese distiller Suntory, following their takeover of Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd. during 1994. Suntory had previously been a shareholder in Morrison Bowmore for several years.[3] <u> Production[edit] </u> Bowmore Distillery sources as much barley as possible from on the island of Islay, but there are insufficient quantities produced to satisfy the distillery\'s demand, so barley is also imported from the mainland. The distillery retains a traditional floor malting, but this also lacks sufficient capacity; the barley imported from the mainland is normally already malted.[1] The distillery has an annual capacity of 2,000,000 litres, with fermentation undertaken in traditional wooden washbacks before the liquid is passed through two wash stills and then through two spirit stills.[3][4] The waste heat from the distillation process goes to heat a nearby public swimming_pool that was built in one of the distillery\'s former warehouses.[4] Morrison Bowmore bottles all whisky produced at Bowmore Distillery and their other distilleries at a facility in Springburn, Glasgow.[6] <u> Products[edit] </u> Bowmore 12 Year, 750ml bottle Standard Range[7] Bowmore Legend\n* Bowmore Legend\n* Bowmore 12 Year Old\n* Bowmore 15 Year Old\n* Bowmore 18 Year Old\n* Bowmore 25 Year Old Travel Retail[7]\n* Bowmore Surf\n* Bowmore 12 Years Enigma\n* Bowmore 15 Years Mariner\n* Bowmore 17 Year Old\n* Bowmore Cask Strength\n* Bowmore 100 Degrees Proof USA Range[8]\n* Bowmore 12 Year Old\n* Bowmore 15 Year Old\n* Bowmore 17 Year Old\n* Bowmore 25 Year Old\n* Bowmore 30 Year Old\n* Bowmore Cask\n* Bowmore Dawn\n* Bowmore Dusk\n* Bowmore Darkest\n* Bowmore Legend Bowmore also produce a number of special edition bottlings and market&#8211;specific bottlings.

The Brackla whisky produced was selected by King William IV of the United Kingdom to be his whisky for the Royal Court, which turned Brackla into the benchmark of Quality. In 1833 [1] Brackla Distillery became the first whisky distillery to be granted a Royal Warrant by order of King William IV of the United Kingdom. This made Royal Brackla one of only three distilleiess ever honoured to bear the name \'Royal\', the others being active distillery Royal Lochnagar and demolished distillery Glenury Royal. Queen Victoria renewed the Royal Warrant in 1838. In 1839 William Fraser &amp; Co took over the Royal Brackla Distillery [2] and it was passed from William Fraser to his son Robert Fraser in 1852. It was in 1878 that Robert Fraser disposed of the distillery to the firm Robert Fraser &amp; Co[3] and in 1879 the company was reconstructed as the Brackla Distillery Co Ltd. The 1897 Prospectus reveals that the capital of the company was\n100,000, divided into 40,000 preference and 60,000 ordinary shares. The Directors of the company were James Anderson, Wine Merchant, Leith, Andrew Usher of Northfield, John Usher of Norton and Walter C. Newbigging, distiller at Brackla. The Prospectus also reported: \"Brackla\'s whisky has long been known as one of the best Highland malt whiskies in the market. The demand for it has for years been much in excess of the supply, and in order to cope with this demand considerable additions have recently been made to the distillery.\" The distillery and warehouse, at this time, was on a site of over 13 acres, this was held under lease from the Earl of Cawdor. In 1919 John Mitchel and James Leith of Aberdeen acquired the company but then sold it in 1926 to John Bisset &amp; Co Ltd of Leith. They were taken over by the Distillers Company Ltd in 1943. Due to restrictions on the use of barley for distilling during the Second World War a majority of Scotch Whisky distilleries closed, including the Royal Brackla Distillery from 1943 until 1945. An airfield was built beside the distillery in 1940, to provide a landing ground for operational training and air gunnery. 1964 saw the distillery close its doors again until 1966, this was due to major reconstruction and re&#8211;planning. The traditional method of coal&#8211;firing the stills by hand was changed to internal heating by steam generated from a coal&#8211; fired boiler. In 1965 an underground supply of water, created during the Second World War for an airfield, was acquired and used for cooling spirit vapour. In 1970 the distillery was expanded by adding a second pair of stills and converting the coal&#8211;fired boiler to oil&#8211;fired. New racked warehouses were built in 1975 to replace the older traditional warehouses that were still in use at the time. The Royal Brackla Distillery closed again in 1985. The casks of whisky remained on site in the warehouses where they continued to mature and be used for blending, as required by the owners. The distillery reopened in 1991. <u> Methods of production[edit] </u> Royal Brackla has a mash tun, 12.5 tonnes and eight wash backs with a total volume of 480,000 litres. Cawdor Burn has been the constant water supply for Royal Brackla, with the Cursack Springs being used for mashing. The distillery uses four stills to produce its whisky, two wash stills with a combined capacity of 42,000 litres and two spirit stills that have combined capacity of 42,000 litres. The fermentation process lasts for a total of 70 hours and is followed by the distillation process. Tall Royal Brackla stills, designed to allow plenty of reflux, are operated slowly in the distillation process to smooth the blend to maximise copper contact and produce a light spirit. The final stage is maturation and this takes place in oak casks. <u> Proprietary bottlings[edit] </u> 1991: To commemorate the re&#8211;opening of Royal Brackla Distillery, a special 60 year old Royal Brackla single malt was released. It was claimed the cask (from 1924) was discovered in a warehouse in 1984. 40%, 70cl. 1993: Royal Brackla was released as a 10&#8211;year&#8211;old in the Flora and Fauna series, produced by United Distillers. The label featured a small bird called a siskin. 43%, 70cl. 1998: Part of United Distillers Rare Malts Collection included a bottling of Royal Brackla at 20 years old. It was distilled in 1978 and was cask strength. 50.8%, 70cl. 1999: John Dewar &amp; Sons Ltd released a minor bottling of Royal Brackla with a burgundy label and no age statement. 40%, 70cl. 2003: A limited edition 25 year old was released for the keepers of the Quaich, each label signed by Tom Aitken, John Dewar &amp; Sons\' sixth Master Blender. 43%, 70cl. 2004: Dewar\'s released the 10&#8211;year&#8211;old single malt bottling in order to make a small amount of the whisky available to the public. 40%, 70cl. <u> Promotion[edit] </u> The Caledonian Mercury, 13 February 1826 reported: There was shipped at Inverness on Thursday, on board the George of Inverness, for different houses in London, upwards of 900 gallons of genuine malt spirits, from the Brackla Distillery and supposed to be the first ever shipped at that port by the permission od government &#8211; Inverness journal. The Newcastle Courant, 18 December 1830 reported: Barley WANTED for Royal Brackla Distillery, 1000 Quarters of Fine MALTING BARLEY, and to be delivered at the Harbour of Nairn viz: &#8211; 300 Quarters in all December 1830; 300 Quarters in April; and 400 quarters in July 1831. The grain will require to be of the best Malting Quality. Samples, with the Weight per Bushel, to be sent to the Address of Captain Fraser, Brackla, Nairn; or to the agent in Edinburgh, William Tait, 12 Infirmary Street. All letters to be Post&#8211; paid &#8211; Inverness 9 December 1830. The Morning Chronicle, 20 January 1835 reported: His Majesty having been pleased to distinguish this \'by his Royal Command to supply his establishment\' has placed this whisky first on the List of British Spirits, and when known should in truth be termed \'The Drink Divine\' &#8211; only to be had of the importers, Graham &amp; Co, New Road, facing Mary&#8211;la&#8211;bone Workhouse. The Morning Post, 7 May 1836 reported: THE KING\'S OWN WHISKY, distilled expressly for the use of his Majesty at Fraser\'s Royal Brackla Distillery, Inverness, is perhaps the only malt spirit which proves alike congenial to the palate and constitution of connaisseurs of every country. It is peat&#8211;flavoured, but far from rank &#8211; strong, but not fiery, and produces the most exquisite Punch or Toddy. As consignees, we offer the KING\'S OWN WHISKY to the Trade at the mere commission of the invoice price; and to enable private families to detect spurious fabrication, which may be imposed upon them, we undertake on all occasions to draw this fine spirit from the original Highland puncheons, at 20s per imperial gallon; to bottle it at 44s per dozen, bottles inclusive, or (for more general accommodation) to supply single sealed bottles at 3s 9d each.

Using an inheritance, the three brothers combined their talents to build a third distillery Bruichladdich designed by John, engineered by Robert, and financed by William and other family members. At the time, the distillery was a state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art design unlike Islay\'s older distilleries, which had developed from old farm buildings. It was built from stone from the sea shore and has a very efficient layout, built around a large, spacious courtyard. The uniquely tall and narrow&#8211;necked stills were chosen to produce a very pure and original spirit, the opposite of the styles produced by the older farm distilleries. Bruichladdich was run by William Harvey, after a quarrel with his brothers before the distillery was even completed, until a fire in 1934 and his death in 1936. Over the next forty years it subsequently changed owners several times as a result of corporate take&#8211;overs and rationalisation of the industry, narrowly avoiding closure until 1994, when it was shut down as being \'surplus to requirements\'. The distillery was subsequently purchased by a group of private investors led by Mark Reynier of Murray_McDavid on 19 December 2000. Jim McEwan, who had worked at Bowmore_Distillery since the age of 15, was hired as master distiller and production director. Between January and May 2001 the whole distillery was dismantled and reassembled, with the original Victorian d cor and equipment retained. Having escaped modernisation, most of the original Harvey machinery is still in use today. No computers are used in production with all processes controlled by a pool of skilled artisans who pass on information orally and largely measure progress using dipsticks and simple flotation devices. On 23 July 2012, it was announced that R my_Cointreau reached an agreement with Bruichladdich to buy the distillery for a sum of\n58m.[2] <u> Today[edit] </u> All the distillery s whiskies are sold as single malts, with those designated Bruichladdich being unpeated, those designated Port Charlotte being heavily peated and those designated Octomore being super&#8211;heavily peated. Octomore is considered to be \'the most heavily peated single malt whisky in the world\'. The distillery moved to full production in 2013. All barley used is exclusively Scottish, some of which has been grown on Islay since 2004. The provenance of the barley used is extremely important philosophically and this is increasingly reflected in the marketing and presentation of the product range. Individual farms, farmers and even the fields in which the grain is grown, are identified on the packaging where possible. The distillery\'s commitment to Islay has resulted in the creation of an island&#8211; based management and administrative system, including the construction of the island\'s only commercially&#8211;scaled bottling hall. The company is the largest private employer on Islay with around sixty jobs on the island. From 2009, Bruichladdich was distributed in the UK by Blavod_Wines_and_Spirits plc.[3] In 2013 it set up its own UK distribution company Bruichladdich UK Distribution Ltd, which is based in Glasgow. In 2011, the distillery started production of gin, The_Botanist. <u> Victorian Equipment[edit] </u> The distillery still uses the original \'open\' 7&#8211;tonne mashtun the only one on the island, and one of only a handful still in existence. There are six wooden washbacks made from Douglas Fir (sometimes called Oregon Pine), together, 210,000 litres. There are two wash stills (together 23,000 litres), two unusually tall (6 metre) and narrow&#8211;necked (0.9m) spirit stills (together 21,000 litres). Annual output is currently 1.5 million ola s, which is considered close to current capacity. Much of the equipment in use is the original Victorian equipment. The process is gravity fed and no computers are used in production, apart from in the offices clerically and to run a series of eight webcams. These webcams were the focus of an intelligence operation by the (American) Defense_Threat_Reduction Agency, when the distillery\'s antique distilling equipment was mistaken for that purportedly used for Iraq\'s elusive chemical_weapons.[4] This story has roots in an e&#8211;mail sent by an American agent to the distillery when one of the webcams had broken.[5] A limited run of commemorative WMD bottles were released in honour of the story, while a second WMD bottling, Yellow Submarine, was issued when an Islay fisherman found a MoD submarine ROV, and a minor farcical affair ensued.[6] In 2010 the last authentic Lomond_still (recovered during the demolition of Inverleven distillery in Dumbarton) was installed at Bruichladdich and, following modifications by Master Distiller Jim McEwan, this commenced distillation of\nThe_Botanist\nIslay dry gin in 2011 . All stills are heated using steam.[7] <u> Distillery Views[edit] </u>\n* [Distillery&#8211;view.jpg]\n* [Distilleryview2.jpg]\n* [Bruichladdichcask.jpg] <u> In popular culture[edit] </u>\n* In the 1990 BBC television production of the political thriller House_of\nCards, Chief Whip Francis_Urquhart offers reporter Mattie_Storin a glass\nof Bruichladdich when she arrives for an interview, remarking,\n\"Bruichladdich, if you know your malts.\"\n* In the 2010 film Morning_Glory, Harrison_Ford\'s character Mike Pomeroy\ndrinks Bruichladdich.\n* In the 2011 film Carnage, directed by Roman_Polanski, the two couples\nshare a bottle of 18&#8211;year&#8211;old Bruichladdich.\n* It was featured in an episode of the BBC2 series Oz_and_James_Drink_to\nBritain, in which they were given a tour of the distillery and allowed to\ntry some of the prized \'X4\', quadruple&#8211;distilled Perilous Whisky, of\nwhich Martin_Martin wrote in 1695 \"the first taste affects all the\nmembers of the body; two spoonfuls of this last liquor is a sufficient\ndose; and if any man exceed this, it would presently stop his breath, and\nendanger his life.

It was founded in 1846 by Hector_Henderson. The distillery did not fare well, and changed hands in 1854 when Norman_Buchanan, owner of the Isle_of_Jura Distillery, took over. In 1863 the business was acquired by Bulloch Lade &amp; Co, of Glasgow, traders in whisky stocks. By the 1880s over 147,000 gallons of whisky were produced there each year. In 1920 Bulloch Lade went into voluntary liquidation, and a consortium of businessmen formed the Caol Ila Distillery Company Ltd. In 1927 the Distillers Company acquired a controlling interest in Caol Ila, and in 1930 Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd obtained ownership of all the shares. The distillery closed during World_War_II, from 1942 to 1945, because of wartime restrictions on the supply of barley to distillers. From then, production continued until 1972, when the entire structure of the distillery was demolished. A larger distillery was then built, designed by George Leslie Darge in the same architectural style as many of his others with his trademark glazed curtain walls to the still houses, and production resumed in 1974. The company eventually became part of Diageo. <u> The whisky[edit] </u> Caol Ila is one of the lighter Islay whiskies, pale in colour, with peaty, floral and peppery notes. In addition to being sold as a single_malt, it is used heavily in blends such as Johnnie_Walker and Black_Bottle. Since 1999, the distillery has also produced a non&#8211;peated \"highland spirit\".[6] <u> Awards[edit] </u> Different expressions of Caol Ila have generally rated highly at spirit_ratings competitions. The 12&#8211;year, for example, received two double gold, three gold, and one silver medal from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2005 and 2010. It also received an above&#8211;average score of 90&#8211;95 from Wine Enthusiast in 2005.[7] The 18&#8211; and 25&#8211;year expressions, though not as frequently rated by outside agencies, have also tended to score well.[8] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Islay_whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* Whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Caol_Ila_at_Whisky.com\n2. ^ Caol_Ila_12_years_on_Whisky.com\n3. ^ Caol_Ila_Cask_Strength_on_Whisky.com\n4. ^ Caol_Ila_18_years_on_Whisky.com\n5. ^ Caol_Ila_25_Years_on_Whisky.com\n6. ^ http://www.whisky&#8211;news.com/En/distilleries/Caol%20Ila.html\n7. ^ \"Proof66.com_Caol_Ila_12&#8211;Year_Awards\".

The distillery is currently run by Diageo and the distillery\'s Scotch_whisky makes up an important part of the famous Johnnie_Walker blended whiskies. The word \"Cardhu\" derives from the Scots Gaelic Carn Dubh, meaning \"Black Rock\" [1] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_\'Pure_Malt\'_Controversy\n* 3_Cardhu_single_malt\n* 4_See_also\n* 5_References\n* 6_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> The distillery was set up by John Cumming, who had previously been a whisky smuggler, in 1824. The distillery was sited high up on Mannoch Hill, above the River_Spey due to the peat softening the water. The distillery started as farm distillery working on a seasonal basis after the harvest had been gathered. The distillery was mainly run by his wife Helen who used to sell bottles of whisky to passers&#8211;by through the window of their farmhouse. In 1885 the distillery was rebuilt on a new piece of land but continued to stay in the hands of the Cummings, being run by Elizabeth Cumming, the daughter&#8211;in&#8211; law of Helen Cumming. The stills from the old distillery building were sold to William_Grant who set up Glenfiddich distillery. The new building and stills meant that Cardhu could produce triple the amount of whisky it had previously produced. These higher production levels led to Johnnie_Walker_and_Sons buying much of Cardhu\'s output to put into their increasingly popular blend. In 1893 Elizabeth Cumming sold the distillery to Johnnie_Walker_and_Sons on the condition that the Cumming family could continue the day&#8211;to&#8211;day running of the distillery. Cardhu distillery kept working under these conditions until the onset of the Second_World_War when wartime restrictions meant that it was harder to use barley for distilling purposes. In 1960 the distillery\'s still&#8211;house, mash&#8211;house and tun&#8211;room were rebuilt, and in 1970 steam coils were introduced to heat the stills and the number of stills was increased to six. Spring water from Mannoch Hill started to be mixed with water from the local Lynne burn to supply the increased production of the distillery. <u> \'Pure Malt\' Controversy[edit] </u> Cardhu Single Malt and original label Pure Malt side by side In December 2003, parent company Diageo caused controversy[2][3] by halting the production of Cardhu single malt and replacing it with a blended_malt which they labelled a \'pure malt\' using the same bottle design and label as its single malt. This was done in order to keep up with increased demand for the whisky, particularly in Spain and Portugal, as well as for use in Johnnie Walker blended whiskies. The decision by Diageo angered both consumers and other whisky producers who were worried that the single malt image would be damaged. Diageo responded to the criticism by agreeing to change the label style and colour of their pure malt in order to avoid consumer_confusion.[4][5] Sales of Cardhu pure malt dropped substantially due to the change.[6] <u> Cardhu single malt[edit] </u> Cardhu recommenced producing a single malt in 2006.[6] Cardhu single malt is 40% ABV and has 222 calories per 100ml.[7] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ http://whiskycast.com/resources/other&#8211;resources/scotch&#8211;distillery&#8211;\nnames&#8211;pronunciations/\n2. ^ Hunt, Tony.

The name Craigellachie means \'rocky hill\' and refers to the cliff that overlooks the Spey across from The_Macallan distillery. Bacardi operates the distillery through its subsidiary Dewar &amp; Sons. Dewar &amp; Sons also controls Royal_Brackla, Aberfeldy, Aultmore, and Macduff. <u> History[edit] </u> The Craigellachie distillery was built in 1891 by Craigellachie Distillery Co. Limited, a group of blenders and merchants led by Alexander Edward. Two years later, it was incorporated as a limited company and in 1896 it was reconstructed as Craigellachie&#8211;Glenlivet Distillery Ltd. During the years that followed, ownership passed to Peter Mackie (in 1916), the Distillery Company Limited (in 1927) and SMD (in 1930). The transfer to SMD marked the beginning of a period of stability for Craigellachie; apartfrom a reconstruction in 1964&#8211;65 during which the number of pot stills was doubled, relatively little happened at the distillery. In 1998, it was sold to John Dewar &amp; Sons. During its history, the distillery has released only a handful of official bottlings. The distillery\'s product is currently primarily used for Dewar\'s blended whisky. </string>

The distillery is best known for producing a single_malt scotch_whisky of the same name. Its location and flavour qualify it as a \"Highland malt\". The Dalmore distillery is owned and operated by Whyte_and_Mackay_Ltd, which is owned by Philippines based Emperador_Inc.[7] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_Establishment\n* 2_Whiskies\n* 3_Awards\n* 4_Record_price\n* 5_References\n* 6_External_links <u> Establishment[edit] </u> The Distillery was established in 1839 by Alexander_Matheson, a trader who made his fortune in illegal opium imports from the Far East. It sits on the banks of the Cromarty Firth overlooking the Black Isle, the \"big meadowland\", from which it takes its name. The distillery was bought by the MacKenzie family in 1886. It has been passed down that in 1263, a predecessor of the Clan MacKenzie saved King Alexander III from a rampaging stag whilst out hunting. In reward, the King allowed him to bear the Royal emblem of a 12&#8211;pointed stag in his coat of arms. Recently, the MacKenzie motto Luceo non Uro or I shine, not burn has also been taken up by Dalmore. In a renewed effort to popularise the brand, the packaging was recently re&#8211; designed, which includes the addition of the Dalmore\'s \"twelve&#8211;pronged stag\" from the clan crest on each bottle. <u> Whiskies[edit] </u> The award&#8211;winning Dalmore Single Highland Malt Whisky Collection is matured in a wooden casks (both sherry wood and American white oak) which, along with the years and the climate, contributes to the flavour of each malt. The Dalmore is aimed at both the mainstream and high&#8211;class markets. \"The 50\" is the oldest, and most expensive, whisky sold by the distillery, and only available 10 cl bottles, of which only 242 were produced. Apart from winning a Gold Quality Award at the 2006 World Quality Selections, organized by Monde Selection,[8] \"the 40\" won gold at the International Wine and Spirit Challenge Awards in both 2007 and 2008. Dalmore Single Highland Malt Whisky is distributed in Australia by Think Spirits. <u> Awards[edit] </u> Dalmore offerings have generally performed very well at international spirit ratings competitions. Posting solid ratings at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and Beverage Testing Institute, the 18&#8211;year in particular has done well. Proof66 rates the Dalmore 18&#8211;Year amongst the Top 20 scotches in the world.[9] <u> Record price[edit] </u>\n* On 15 April 2005, a bottle of 62&#8211;year&#8211;old Dalmore was sold by Denis\nBarthe, Bar Manager of the Ascot Bar at Pennyhill Park Hotel in Bagshot\nSurrey, for\n32,000. The blend was a mix of five casks, from 1868, 1878,\n1922, 1926 and 1939. Only 12 bottles were produced.[10]\n* In 2010 the distillery completed production of Dalmore Trinitas, so\ncalled because only three bottles were produced.

The distillery was founded with the name of the nearby town Strathspey in the late 1890s. The site was chosen for its access to clear spring water from Lochan&#8211;Doire&#8211;Uaine and abundant peat from the surrounding bogs. Set in splendid mountain scenery, Dalwhinnie is the one of the highest distilleries in Scotland. The name Dalwhinnie is derived from Gaelic word Dail&#8211;coinneeamh, which means meeting place, referring to the meeting of ancient cattle drovers\' routes through the mountains. In 1897, John Grant, George Sellar and Alexander Mackenzie founded the Strathspey distillery. Production started in 1898 but unfortunately the partnership was bankrupt the same year. The distillery was sold to AP Blyth in 1898 for his son who renamed it Dalwhinnie. Later in 1905 the Cook &amp; Bernheimer took control over the distillery.[2] The distillers were looking for malts to produce blended whiskies for the US market. This was the very first US investment in the Scotch whisky industry. The US adventure continued until the prohibition in the US in 1920 and the distillery returned to Scotland when it was purchased by Lord James Calder, shareholder of whisky blender MacDonald Greenlees. MacDonald Greenlees was later acquired by Distillers_Company; Dalwhinnie later became part of the blender group James_Buchanan. A fire in 1934 stopped production for 3 years, and the reopening in 1938 was short&#8211;lived because the second_world_war brought restrictions on the supply of barley. Since reopening in 1947, the distillery has continued to operate through to the present day, although on&#8211;site malting ceased in 1968. In 1986, the distillery and bonded warehouse was listed as a Category B listed building.[3] Dalwhinnie has become famous worldwide because it is marketed by its owners, United_Distillers unit of Diageo, under their Classic_Malts brand, launched in 1988. Despite this, only 10% of the production is marketed as single malt, the remaining being used in the Black &amp; White blends. <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> Notes[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Dalwhinnie_distillery\n2. ^ Brander_1996, p.\n3. ^ \"Dalwhinnie_Distillery_and_Bonded_Warehouse\".

Deanston Distillery started life in 1785 as a cotton_mill designed by Sir Richard_Arkwright, and remained as such for 180 years until it was transformed into a distillery in 1966.

The Scots word\ndean\nwas coupled with the Scots Gaelic term toun , meaning farm/settlement, to make Deanston. Deanston was largely an agricultural area until John Buchanan and his brothers from Carston had the foresight to convert an existing flax mill into a water&#8211; powered carding and roving factory with the latest machinery. Designed by Arkwright, inventor of the water&#8211;powered spinning frame, the mill was opened in 1785 as the Adelphi Mill, after the Greek word adelphoi meaning\nbrothers The mill was powered by the River Teith and was one of the first half&#8211;dozen mills of this type to be built in Scotland. Its opening signalled the start of a period of great change for Deanston, which was inhabited with Highlanders who had been evicted in the Clearances and were reluctant to work in the mill. After a difficult start, the mill s fortune was transformed by the arrival of Kirkman Finlay (of Glasgow merchants James Finlay &amp; Co) and the vibrant James Smith, who was installed as manager in 1806/7, aged just seventeen, and remained at the helm for 35 years. Smith embarked on a massive modernisation of Deanston between 1811&#8211;1833, building a new spinning mill, a village, housing, roads, a new weir, new gas works, a large weaving shed, Deanston School, and a fish&#8211;ladder to give salmon access to the upper reaches of the river &#8211; the original model of which can be seen at the distillery today. His biggest innovation was the engineering works which built machinery for Catrine Mill, as well exporting to all parts of Britain and Europe. Smith s talents did not end with the modernisation of the mill, as he also became famous for his deep soil drainage system known as Deanstonisation. <u> Innovation[edit] </u> In its early days, Deanston Mill was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland and developed a number of nationally important innovations which continue to impact the distillery today. Due to a shortage of currency at the time, Deanston was the first major industrial works to produce its own currency. The French Revolution and Napoleonic War meant that silver and gold were drained away to pay for hostilities and as a result, Deanston Mill countermarked Spanish and French coins and issued them to workers and suppliers as pay. Very few of these coins still exist, however one is currently on display at the distillery. The mill and village houses were originally lit by candles and oil lamps but in 1813, Deanston Mill was lit by gas\nsaid to be the first gasworks in the west of Scotland and ahead of Westminster_Bridge, which was not lit until 1913. By 1833, Deanston was powered by four large water wheels &#8211; the first two small wheels were reconstructions of the original Adelphi Mill wheels and the third wheel was called Samson. The fourth wheel (named Hercules) measured 36 ft 6in in diameter, was of 300 horse power, and was the largest waterwheel in Europe and the second largest in the world. Original footage of these colossal wheels in operation was recently unearthed and can now be viewed at the distillery. The wheels were dismantled in 1949 and replaced by a more efficient hydro&#8211; turbine and steam electricity generating plant, which currently provides enough energy for all of the distillery s requirements, as well as producing a surplus which is sold back to the National Grid. Deanston Mill was heavily influenced by Arkwright s classical style of architecture and this is a striking feature of the distillery today. The elegant 204 ft long, 136 ft wide vaulted warehouse, previously the weaving shed, is recognised to be one of the greatest surviving Regency industrial buildings in Scotland, and is now used to mature Deanston Single Malt whisky. Construction began in 1834; its remarkable cast&#8211;iron cupola roof was insulated with soil to bring it up to the best temperature for weaving cotton (80 degrees farenheight) and also helped to deaden the noise of the hundreds of working looms inside. The soil on the roof was utilised as a community vegetable garden. <u> Deanston Village[edit] </u> Main article: Deanston In a similar way to David_Dale s model community at New_Lanark, Deanston village was built by mill owners James Finlay &amp; Co to provide housing for the workers. The first houses were erected in 1811 &#8211; common entrances gave way to self&#8211;contained apartments, with attics for drying clothes and storage, and good coal&#8211;burning ranges were provided. Nearly every able&#8211;bodied woman worked in the mill; therefore easily run homes were an investment for the company. A local school was provided and is still educating the future generation to this day. Young children attended school from age five and were expected to read and do sums before entering the mill when they were nine. Children between the ages of 13&#8211;16 attended an evening school four days a week. A communal washhouse, drapery, post office, savings bank and grocery shops were also built in Deanston. By 1844, the mill employed 1100 people, many of whom were women and children. Little has changed in Deanston village since the days of the cotton mill. A large proportion of the village is currently listed, marking its special architectural and historic interest. The vaulted warehouse, weir, and old spinning mill are category_A_listed_buildings,[2][3][4] and Deanston School and the village cottages are category C listed. The distillery still keeps the river bank tidy, cuts the grass on behalf of the village, and is still very much an integral part of the Deanston community. <u> Conversion[edit] </u> In 1841 James Smith retired from the mill. Operations continued but by 1848, production at Deanston was in decline. The turn of the twentieth century saw a further decrease in demand for cotton and the workforce was scaled down from 1500 to 500 people. Things steadily got worse until the mill was closed on 2 April 1965. It was the collective efforts of James Finlay &amp; Co, Brodie Hepburn &amp; Co, and A.B (Sandy) Grant, known together as Deanston Distillers Ltd, who converted Deanston Mill into a malt whisky distillery in 1965. The soft, fast flow of the River Teith and a whisky boom in Scotland at the time made the site ideal for whisky production. The distillery was opened on 17 October 1966 after an extensive refurbishment costing\n300,000, employing 20 local people, but taking just nine months. Three floors were removed to make room for four copper stills and a mash tun. The constant, cool temperature of the weaving shed made it ideal for whisky maturation. The only completely new building was the tun room\nwhere eight huge fermentation vessels now stand. When full each of these weighs 60 tonnes and they stand on top of the mill s four underground tunnels leading from the turbine house back to the river. The distillery was formally opened on 30 January 1967 by the actor Andrew Cruickshank, the star of the BBC Dr Finlay s Casebook\nseries. Deanston started bottling in 1971 and the first single malt was named Old Bannockburn. Teith Mill, a blended whisky, was also produced at this time &#8211; a kiosk was set up at Blair Drummond Safari Park which sold Old Bannockburn and Teith Mill in take&#8211;away cartons. At this point, although it made business sense to sell Deanston as a single malt, it was mainly produced for blending purposes. In 1971, Invergordon Distillers (bought by Whyte &amp; Mackay in 1990) bought Brodie Hepburn Ltd, with Tullibardine Distillery and a 30% share in Deanston Distillery. A year later, Invergordon purchased Deanston outright and the first single malt bearing the name Deanston was produced in 1974. After a downturn in the whisky industry, Deanston Distillery ceased production in 1982 for eight years, before being purchased by current owners Burn Stewart Distillers Limited in 1990. <u> Visitor Centre[edit] </u> In June 2012, Burn Stewart Distillers Limited opened a new visitor centre at Deanston, as a means of showcasing the fascinating history of the distillery and offering visitors a unique insight into Scotland s industrial past and traditional whisky production. The visitor centre is located in the former cotton mill canteen, with many original features being retained, and created seven new jobs for local people. It hosts a gift shop which sells exclusive Deanston bottlings, a caf , tasting and presentations areas, and a variety of intimate distillery and tasting tours for locals, tourists and whisky lovers to enjoy. It is expected to attract 15,000 visitors a year and contribute to whisky tourism, an industry which generates an estimated\n30m for the Scottish tourism economy. As the visitor centre opened, the distillery and a number of staff had already attracted international attention as Deanston featured as the distillery location in the Ken_Loach film, The_Angels\'_Share, released in May 2012. One of the stars of the film, Jasmin Riggins, was also present at the opening. <u> Production and character[edit] </u> Deanston Distillery looks very unlike a traditional Scotch whisky distillery and has a number of unique production features which contribute to its distinct character in taste and look. The spirit is handmade by a small team of local craftsmen who rely on traditional distilling techniques and their own eye to ensure quality; no technology or computers are used. Deanston uses only Scottish&#8211;grown barley and in 2000, was one of the first distilleries in Scotland to start producing organic whisky, certified by the Organic Food Federation and using barley grown in specially selected sites, free from pesticides and chemicals. The distillery also boasts an 11&#8211;ton open&#8211;topped mash tun &#8211; the only one of its size in Scotland &#8211; and four unique pot stills with upwards sloping lyne arms and boiling balls, which help give the whisky its light character. The spirit is matured in the original weaving shed designed by Arkwright in the 1830s, which holds a capacity of 45,000 casks. Whisky writer Jim Murray said of Deanston: \"Deanston is a cathedral to whisky maturation. In fact, with its gloriously vaulted ceiling built in the 1830s, you would swear you were in a crypt.\"[citation_needed] In addition to generating its own electricity, Deanston s green credentials were further topped in 2008, when Burn Stewart Distillers Ltd reformulated the liquid and redesigned the packaging to better reflect the Deanston brand essence. All materials are now either recycled or recyclable, and gift tubes were replaced by cardboard gift boxes in order to further reduce weight. Deanston Single Malt whisky is sweet, fruity and balanced with a malty spiciness on the palate. The range currently consists of Deanston 12 YO, Deanston Virgin Oak, and two limited editions, Spanish Oak and Toasted Oak, which are only available at the distillery shop. All spirit is un&#8211;chill filtered; ensuring an authentic tasting dram. About 15% of the spirit produced goes into Deanston Single Malt and the other 85% is used for blends such as Scottish Leader and Black Bottle. Deanston is also in Drumgray Highland Cream Liqueur (which won gold medals in the 1993 and 1999 IWSC competitions) and Wallace Single Malt Liqueur. Deanston 12 YO was recently awarded Gold in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and silver in the International Wine and Spirits Competition. Deanston Virgin Oak also won gold at the Scotch Whisky Masters and silver in both the International Wine and Spirits Competition and International Spirits Challenge. Today Deanston is not only in steady demand from blenders but has a growing acceptance as a premium single malt.

Edradour distillery (Scottish_Gaelic: Eadar Dh\nDhobhar, \"between two rivers\") [2] is a Highland single_malt whisky distillery based in Pitlochry, Perthshire. Its owners claim it to be the smallest distillery in Scotland. It has been owned by the Signatory_Vintage_Scotch_Whisky_Company since 2002, and was previously owned by Pernod_Ricard.[3][4] Signatory, founded in 1988, is primarily an Independent_bottler and is based in Pitlochry.[5] Established in 1825, the distillery was traditionally run by three men, but now there are just two. Only eighteen casks are produced each week. They have a tour which costs\n7.50 and currently includes two drams and a nosing glass. The stills are the smallest in use of any distillery in Scotland. Were they any smaller, they would be deemed by HM Revenue and Customs to be portable, with the implicit capacity for illegal production. The wash still has a capacity of 4,200 Liters and the smaller spirit still 2,200 Liters.[6] A variety of whiskies are available from the distillery. Only the Edradour 10&#8211; year is chill&#8211;filtered, a process by which the esters and oils are removed, producing a cleaner look to the whisky, which when chilled or has ice added to it does not turn cloudy. There is, amongst others, a non&#8211;chill&#8211;filtered 12&#8211; year&#8211;old malt, some of which goes into the \"House of Lords\" and \"Clan Campbell\" blends. Also produced for two days in a week is a heavily&#8211;peated version of the Edradour called Ballechin.[7] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Edradour_distillery\n2. ^ Iain Mac an T illeir. \"Placenames\" (PDF).

It was founded in 1824 on the land of Fasque estate in a converted corn mill[1] by the estate\'s owner Sir Alexander_Ramsay,[2] shortly after the Customs_and_Excise_Act_1823 drastically reduced excise on whisky production under management of James Durie.[3] The licencee was James Stewart &amp; Co.[2] Durie later acquired the distillery himself, and operated it until his death in 1854.[3] The distillery was then known as Nethermill.[2] The stills were replaced in 1832 with stills of the Shand\'s type, similar to Lomond type stills. These stills have necks that can be fitted with plates on different heights to influence the degree of distillation.[2] <u> Overview[edit] </u> After James Durie\'s death, his son David Durie acquired the distillery, and operated it until the distillery was destroyed in a fire in 1887.[4][3] In 1890, The Fettercairn Distillery Co. &#8211; a joint&#8211;stock_company &#8211; was created with Sir_John_Gladstone as its president to resume production.[5] It was rebuilt and extended in 1891,[3] and continued production until 1926, when it was closed down.[1] The distillery resumed production when it was bought by Associated Scottish Distilleries Ltd, a subsidiary of Train &amp; McIntyre Ltd. owned by National Distillers of America in 1939.[6] Fettercairn closed its malting facilities in 1960, and expanded in 1966 from one wash and one spirit still to two wash and two stills of 12,800 litres,[4] [2] bringing its production capacity to the current level of 1,600,000 litres of pure alcohol per year.[6] From 1971, the distillery changed ownership several times. After a range of takeovers and mergers, it finally becomes part of Whyte_&amp;_Mackay Ltd. in 2001, which itself was bought by Vijay_Mallya in 2007.[6] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b Brown, Gordon M.

After running into financial difficulty, the distillery closed in 1870 [1] before being renamed Glenburgie in 1871.[2] It re&#8211;opened in 1878, under Charles Kay.[1] There were several ownership changes in the next decade, lasting until the distillery\'s expansion in 1890. It was then incorporated in 1895. This situation lasted 30 years; it was liquidated in 1925, and then was closed again between 1927 and 1935.[1] Around that time[when?] the distillery was run by Margaret Nichol, considered the first female manager of any whisky distillery. The distillery was sold to Hiram_Walker in 1936.[2] In a new rejuvenation in 1958, two Lomond_stills were installed, alongside the existing stills. The whisky distilled in these stills was kept separate from the rest of the whisky produced by the distillery, and sold under the name Glencraig.[1] Production continued up until 1981 when the experiment with Lomond stills was abandoned, and the stills were replaced with regular stills. In 2000, production stopped entirely at Glenburgie. The distillery was completely rebuilt in 2003&#8211;2004, only retaining the stills from the old distillery.[1] Soon after, in 2006 another two stills were added, bringing the total production capacity to 4,200,000 litres of pure alcohol per year.[1] <u> Distillery[edit] </u> The distillery is located on an estate at the Mill_Buie_hills near Kinloss.[2] <u> Production[edit] </u> Most of the whisky distilled at Glenburgie is used for blends, most importantly Ballantine\'s, but also Old Smuggler. </string>

The distillery is owned by Angus Dundee plc and produces one malt whisky, with the remainder of production sold to blenders or used within Angus Dundee plc for use in blended_whisky brands.[1] <u> History[edit] </u> The Glencadam Distillery was founded in 1825,[2] about 200 yards from Brechin Distillery.[3] The first recorded owner is David Scott, who was proprietor from 1827 to 1837.[1] The distillery changed hands a number of times between 1837 and 1891. Gilmour, Thompson &amp; Company Limited purchased the distillery in 1891 and used some of the Glencadam product in their Royal Blend brand of blended_whisky.[3] The distillery, as with most others, reduced production during World_War_II owing to fuel and grain rationing. Hiram Walker bought the distillery in 1954, they were bought by George Ballantine_&amp;_Son_Ltd two years later, and ownership of the distillery eventually passed to Allied_Domecq through further consolidation in the industry.[3] Allied Domecq mothballed the distillery in 2000 before selling the distillery to the present owners, Angus Dundee plc in 2003. Angus Dundee also own the Tomintoul_Distillery.[1] The present owners quickly resumed production and the product from the distillery is used in their own blended and vatted_malt whisky products, as well as being sold to other blenders. As of July 2010[4] Glencadam Malt Whisky is available in a range of official bottlings aged 10 to 21 years, as a component of Ballantine\'s and Stewart\'s Cream of the Barley blended whiskies, Angus Dundee\'s own blended and vatted whiskies, and in a number of other blended brands. Independent bottlings are also readily available, both as single malt and as vatted malts.[1][3] In November 2008, Angus Dundee plc re&#8211;launched the Glencadam line with new packaging and added a new 10 year&#8211;old single malt. Then, in July 2010 the company added three new expressions: a 21 year&#8211;old, a 12 year&#8211;old finished in port wood, and a 14 year&#8211;old finished in an oloroso sherry cask.[4] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d \"Glencadam_Single_Malt_Scotch_Whisky\".

The distillery was founded in 1826 by James Allardes (referred to often as Allardice) as the second distillery to apply for a licence to legally produce whisky under the Excise_Act_of_1823,[2] which passed three years earlier and which allowed for the distilling of Whisky in Scotland.[3] Other sources credit a consortium of farmers and businessmen for the foundation of the distillery though this could include Allardes. The Glendronach distillery was purchased by Teachers_and_Sons_Ltd around 1960 who increased the number of stills from two to six. In 1996 the distillery was mothballed and reopened again in 2001[4] by the BenRiach Distillery Company. Other notable owners include Walter Scott, who acquired it in 1881 and Charles Grant, son of the founder of the Glenfiddich distillery, in 1920. The distillery draws its water from the Dronac burn within the distillery grounds. It has its own floor maltings and two wash stills in addition to two spirit stills.

Situated approximately 3 miles south of Elgin on the road to Rothes, it was the last distillery to be built during the boom years of the 1890s. The architect, Charles Doig, stated it would be the last one built in Speyside for 50 years. His prediction was remarkably accurate with Tormore being the next distillery built, in 1958. Initially Glen Elgin did not have problems to seek. The owners, William Simpson, a former manager of Glenfarclas, and James Carle, an agent for the North of Scotland Bank, saw their investment of\n13,000 plummet to\n4,000 when they sold the distillery in 1901.The original site was chosen for its water source and close proximity to the railway line. Unfortunately the water source proved unreliable and permission for a railway siding was refused. The distillery soldiered on through several owners before becoming part of DCL in the 1930s. It was then licensed to White Horse Distillers Ltd. Until the 1950s the distillery was entirely operated and lit by paraffin. All machinery was driven by a paraffin engine and a water turbine. It was a full&#8211; time job to keep the paraffin lights burning. Today, the distillery still proudly depicts the White Horse emblem and is part of UDV\'s \"Elgin Group\", along with Linkwood, Glenlossie and Mannochmore. The whisky is still a key component of White Horse blended whisky, which is exported to over 200 countries worldwide. <i> Development[edit] </i> In walking around the distillery you are struck by the contrasts in old and new, big and small. The distillery has a huge storage capacity for malted barley. The 36 malt bins can hold 400 tonnes &#8211; more than the 3 other distilleries in the Elgin group combined. However the ISR (intermediate spirit receiver) which collects the spirit from the stills is very small and has to be pumped empty 3 times a day. Recent investment has seen a new full lauter mash tun installed, replacing the old traditional tun with its geared_rakes. The mash is now continually sparged as opposed to adding separate waters. The worts however are transferred to traditional wooden wash backs for fermentation. The distillery\'s floor maltings were decommissioned in the 1960s with the malt being supplied by large industrial maltings. However, worm tubs were retained for the cooling of the distillate. Although the distillery has seen major refurbishment it retains the look and feel of a small, traditional distillery. There are no space&#8211;age computer panels and the highly regarded whisky continues to be made with a hands&#8211;on approach. <i> The stills and worms[edit] </i> The Glen Elgin spirit and wash stills are similar in size and shape, although the spirit stills have a flatter pot. There is a gentle incline on the lyne arms which lead outside to the worm tubs. The distillery operates a balanced distilling process: each wash back provides 6 individual charges for the wash stills; two wash distillations make up the charge for a spirit distillation. This makes for a busy shift in the still house with 9 separate still charges to be made. Using worm tubs to cool the distilled vapours, as opposed to condensers, adds a depth and richness to the spirit. An added bonus are the fresh water shrimp which thrive in the tubs. <u> The Whisky[edit] </u> The Glen Elgin 12 year old has a positive, aromatic and a whiff of smoke, with notes of almonds, or marzipan.

This put them in a strong position to meet the sudden rise in demand for fine aged whiskies that came with the repeal of prohibition.[7][8] In the 1950s, the Grant family built up an onsite infrastructure that included coppersmiths to maintain the copper stills, and a dedicated cooperage that is now one of the very few remaining in distilleries.[9] In 1956 the Grant\'s brand launched the now&#8211;iconic triangular bottle, designed by Hans_Schleger.[10] Following difficult times in the 1960s and \'70s, many small, independent distillers were bought up or went out of business. In order to survive, W. Grant &amp; Sons expanded their production of the drink, and introduced advertising campaigns and a visitors\' centre.[11] In this period they also took the decision to begin marketing single malt as a premium brand in its own right, effectively creating the modern single_malt_whisky category.[4] Later, W. Grant &amp; Sons was one of the first distilleries to package its bottles in tubes and gift tins, as well as recognising the importance of the duty&#8211;free market for spirits. This marketing strategy was successful, and Glenfiddich has now become the world\'s best&#8211;selling single malt.[12] It is sold in 180 countries,[6] and accounts for about 35% of single malt sales.[13] Glenfiddich is currently managed by the fifth generation of William Grant\'s descendants.[14] In September 2014, William Grant &amp; Sons agreed to acquire Drambuie for an undisclosed price rumoured to be in the region of\n100 million.[15] <u> Production[edit] </u> Glenfiddich whisky is produced at the Glenfiddich Distillery in Dufftown. The water source is the Robbie Dhu springs. Glenfiddich is matured in oak casks such as rum casks from the Caribbean (in the case of 21 year old Gran Reserva), Bourbon_whiskey barrels from America (Ancient Reserve), or sherry butts from Jerez in Spain.[16][17] The distillery uses 28 distinctively&#8211;shaped copper pot stills that are smaller than those now in use at most other distilleries.[18] All are handmade and Glenfiddich employs a team of permanent craftsmen to maintain them.[19] <u> Whiskies[edit] </u>\nGlenfiddich Age&#8211;Statement Whiskies, by years of production, since 1992 Age\n1992 191994 191996 191998 202000 202002 202004 202006 202008 202010 202012 12\nGlenfiddich Year\nCaoran Reserve\n12 Year Old 14\nGlenfiddich Year\nRich Oak 15\nGlenfiddich Year Classic\nSolera Reserve\n15 Year Old 15\n15 Year Old Cask Strength Year\n(renamed Distillery Edition) 18\nGlenfiddich Year Excellence\nAncient Reserve\n18 Year Old 21\nMillenium\nHavana\nGlenfiddich Year\nReserve\nReserve\nGran Reserva\n21 Year Old 30\nGlenfiddich Year\n30 Year Old 38\nGlenfiddich Year\nUltimate 38 40\nGlenfiddich Year\n40 Year Old 50\nGlenfiddich Year\n50 Year Old 64\n1937 Rare Year\nCollection In 1937, cask 843 was filled with spirit from the stills at The Glenfiddich distillery in Dufftown.

The 12, 15, 18, and 21&#8211;year offerings have all rated well in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and the Beverage Testing Institutes\' reviews.[20] On balance, the 15&#8211;year whisky has performed the best, receiving three double&#8211;gold medals (in four years) at the 2007 2010 San Francisco competitions and a score of 91 with the Beverage Testing Institute. [21] <u> In popular culture[edit] </u>\n* Glenfiddich was the favourite whisky of fictional detective Inspector\nMorse, as well as his creator Colin_Dexter.\n* In the movie The_Dogs_of_War, Christopher_Walken is seen carrying two\nbottles of Glenfiddich 10 Year Old in his luggage upon arrival to the\nfictional country of Zangaro.\n* In the 150th episode of Family_Guy, Brian_&amp;_Stewie, Brian_Griffin\nkeeps a bottle of what appears to be Glenfiddich 12 Year Old in a safe\ndeposit box as a last_drink should he intend to kill_himself.

Oldmeldrum in the celebrated \'Valley of the Garioch\' was named \"The Granary of Aberdeenshire\", famous for producing the finest barley in all of Scotland. The distillery, which originally incorporated a brewery and tannery, stands on the very edge of the town Oldmeldrum in Aberdeenshire. The Garioch\npronounced \'Geery\'\nis a tract of richly fertile land, some 150 square miles (390 km2) in extent. The location is known as\nthe granary of Aberdeenshire , where barley and crystal springs have been abundant for over a thousand years, so it is not surprising that Glen Garioch Distillery was established as early as 1794\none of the oldest operating distilleries in Scotland. In 1968 the production of Glen Garioch was suspended on account of \'chronic water shortages\', however in 1972 a manager was appointed with a brief to find another water source. A spring was discovered on a neighboring farm. It came to be called\nThe Silent Spring\nas it could neither be seen nor heard. Leading with the 1797 Founders Reserve at the heart of the range, Glen Garioch will periodically release hand selected individual batches of stock at the peak of their perfection, aiming to demonstrate the quality and breadth of the Glen Garioch spirit.

Following a complete refurbishment by the new owners the distillery was re&#8211;opened on 24 November 2008 by the First Minister for Scotland Alex Salmond MSP who praised the company for their commitment to using the traditional equipment and methods to once again make the unique whisky which is produced at Glenglassaugh.[1] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Gallery\n* 3_References\no 3.1_Notes\no 3.2_Bibliography\n* 4_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> The Glenglassaugh Distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery located in a picturesque site just outside the Speyside region in Northeast Scotland, close to the small town of Portsoy, Banffshire some 54 miles Northwest of Aberdeen. The Distillery was established in 1875 by a local entrepreneur James Moir and his two nephews, Alexander and William Morrison. James Moir had an expanding grocery business in the town of Portsoy and was wanting to establish a distillery that would produce a whisky of the highest quality to satisfy the growing demand from his customers. The site was originally chosen due to its proximity to a clean and pure water supply of the highest quality (Glassaugh Springs), easy access to the nearby barley fields and because it was known locally to have been the site of one of the many illicit distilleries that had operated in the area and which had produced excellent whisky. Following the death of both James Moir and William Morrison, Alexander Morrison was forced to sell the distillery and in 1892 the company was sold to Highland_Distillers and until 2008 has been owned by them. Highland Distillers are a subsidiary of The Edrington_Group. In 1960 it was rebuilt and upgraded to double the production capacity and to yield lighter spirit. However, in 1986, when the whole whisky industry was reviewing operations the economics of running this relatively small and remote distillery, the owners decided that they should stop production and the distillery has stayed silent since then. Around this time, Glenglassaugh was sold to the Edrington Group. The whisky from this distillery had traditionally been used in the production of renowned blended_whiskies such as Cutty_Sark, Laing\'s, and The_Famous_Grouse. In 2008, Glenglassaugh was purchased by the Scaent Group. Under new ownership, it released some the pre&#8211;1986 stock as exclusive Highland Single Malt Scotch Whiskies with outstanding success. At the 2009 International Wine and Spirit Competition Awards the 30 Year Old expression was awarded a Gold Medal (Best in Class) and the trophy for Best Cask Strength Scotch Whisky and the 40 Year Old was awarded Gold Medal (Best in Class) and the trophy for Best 40 Year Old Scotch Whisky. The 40 year old was also awarded Best 40 Year Old Scotch Whisky and 96 points in Jim Murray\'s 2010 Whisky Bible. Upon purchase, Scaent refurbished the mothballed distillery and restarted production. In 2009 the company also introduced 2 new innovative products which are produced using the same process as that used for making single malt scotch whisky but without the ageing process. \"The Spirit Drink that dare not speak its name\" is the result of 1 mash of malted barley, fermented and distilled twice. The product is bottled without ageing at 50% abv. \"The Spirit Drink that blushes to speak its name\" is also produced in the same way but is allowed to age for 6 months in casks that have previously held red wine. The result is a spirit with a rich rose hue and a flavour of soft fruits and spices and is ideal as a cocktail base or for making long drinks. On 16 December 2011 the first bottling of Glenglassaugh whisky from spirit distilled under the present ownership was bottled and released for sale only from the distillery shop.[2] In March of 2013, The Benriach Distillery Company acquired the Glenglassaugh distillery from its previous owners, who were listed as Amsterdam&#8211;based Lumiere Holdings.[3] Benriach Distillery company also operates the Benriach and Glendronach Distilleries. The history of Glenglassaugh distillery up to and including the first launches by the Scaent Group was described by whisky writer Ian Buxton in his book Glenglassaugh: A Distillery Reborn (NWP, Glasgow. July 2010). Buxton also worked as marketing consultant and adviser to the relaunch. <u> Gallery[edit] </u>\n* Old Maltings\n* Filling Store\n* Old Cooperage\n* Old Warehouse\n* Distillery Entrance\n* Old Glenglassaugh Windmill\n* Old Warehouse Roof\n* Old Windmill From Road <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ \"Distillery_to_make_whisky_again\".

Glengoyne is unique in producing Highland_single_malt whisky matured in the Lowlands. Located upon the Highland_Line, the division between the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland, Glengoyne s stills are in the Highlands while maturing casks of whisky rest across the road in the Lowlands. Unlike many malt whisky distilleries, Glengoyne does not use peat smoke to dry their barley, but instead uses warm air. <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\no 1.1_Illicit_stills\no 1.2_Whisky_production\n* 2_Modern_era_and_expansion\n* 3_Production_and_character\n* 4_Products\no 4.1_Current_Range\no 4.2_Past_range\n* 5_See_also\n* 6_References\no 6.1_Notes\no 6.2_Sources\n* 7_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> <i> Illicit stills[edit] </i> In the early nineteenth century, due to the heavy taxes on spirit production imposed by the government, many whisky producers were forced to operate illegally. The area around Glengoyne was full of hills and forests which provided excellent cover for the distillers. Records show that at least eighteen illicit whisky stills were operating in the area.[4] In the 1820s an Act_of_Parliament was passed, which reduced the cost of the license required to distil, and the duty payable on spirit sales.[5] Shortly after the introduction of the \'Excise Act of 1823\' (or \'Walsh Act\'[5]) the first of these illicit stills came into official existence, with Glengoyne following later in 1833.[4] Although Glengoyne only officially existed from 1833 and no records exist from before this date, it is believed that distilling on the site pre&#8211;dates that with a local historian writing that the smoke of \"illicit stills\" was visible in the area in the early 19th century.[6] <i> Whisky production[edit] </i> The distillery began distilling in 1833 and was known as the Burnfoot distillery.[6][7] It was originally owned by George Connell who built the distillery and took out a lease on the surrounding land, on which was built a warehouse which is still in use today.[4] In 1876 the distillery was sold, by Archiball G. MacLellen,[7] to the Lang Brothers who were based in Glasgow.[6] [7] It is stated that the Langs intended to name the distillery Glengoyne, but due to a mistake by a clerk it was recorded as Glen Guin.[7] In 1894,[7] or 1905[1] it was changed to Glengoyne which comes from \'Glenguin\' or \'Glen of the Wild Geese\'.[4] The distillery remained with the Lang Brothers until taken over by the Robertson &amp; Baxter Group in 1965, who later became the Edrington_Group.[1] In 1966 and 1967 the number of stills was increased from two to three as the distillery underwent a rebuilding project. In 1984 the Lang Brothers became suppliers of whiskies to the then Queen Mother, Her Majesty Queen_Elizabeth\'s household. The Royal_Warrant has since been delegated to Ian Macleod and is featured on all Glengoyne products.[8] Glengoyne Distillery <u> Modern era and expansion[edit] </u> In April 2003, Ian Macleod Distillers Ltd. acquired Glengoyne Distillery, and the \'Glengoyne Single Malt\' and \'Langs Blended Whisky\' brands. The acquisition of Glengoyne Distillery meant that Ian Macleod became a fully integrated distiller, blender and bottler. Under Ian Macleod, Glengoyne saw a vast increase in output capacity as well as a similar rise in sales.[3] Speaking of the acquisition and planned expansions in 2003, Leonard Russell, managing director for Ian Macleod stated \"We\'ll be aiming to increase sales of the Glengoyne from the current level of 450,000 litres to one million litres next year\".[9] Later, speaking in 2005 Russell stated \"we continue to make whisky exactly the same way at Glengoyne\".[6] The original warehouse built by George Connell is still be found on the site, as the shop and visitor reception area. Today, Glengoyne has eight working warehouses with a total capacity of nearly two million litres (4.5 million bottles) or spirit.[6] <u> Production and character[edit] </u> Glengoyne Distillery is situated at Dumgoyne, on the south&#8211;western edge of the Scottish_Highlands, close to Loch_Lomond and to the north of Glasgow. Although distilled in the Highlands, making Glengoyne a Highland_single_malt, the whisky is matured in the Lowlands. This is because the distillery itself sits upon the Highland_Line, the division between the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland which splits the distillery in two.[10] The boundary line runs underneath the A81 road from Glasgow to Aberfoyle and passes in front of the distillery with the warehouses located to the southwest of the road.[6] Glengoyne is located immediately adjacent the West Highland Way, the most popular long walk in Scotland, and regularly enjoys visits from hikers. Glengoyne is regularly referred to as the \"most beautiful distillery in Scotland\".[6][9][11][12] The distillery has been in continuous operation producing Highland single malt whisky for over 175 years[4] with a current distilling capacity of over one million litres of alcohol and over 35,000 visitors per annum.[13] Glengoyne, along with The_Macallan, is one of only two distilleries remaining today that uses Golden Promise barley which is low in yield but high in quality.[6] The distillery\'s water supply comes from the Glengoyne Burn which flows from the nearby Dumgoyne hill into the distillery grounds before continuing on to Loch_Lomond.[6] Unlike many malt whiskys Glengoyne does not use peat smoke to dry their barley but instead favours the use of warm air.[14] The clear and bright appearance and distinctive flavour of the Glengoyne single malts are credited to this lack of peat smoke.[15] This rare characteristic is utilised in the marketing of Glengoyne with the use of the promotional slogan \"The authentic taste of malt whisky untainted by peat smoke\".[16] As a result of the use of unpeated malt Glengoyne has been noted as being stylistically closer to a Lowland_single_malt as opposed to a Highland single malt.[6][17][18] <u> Products[edit] </u> At its current operating capacity Glengoyne produces over one million litres of pure spirit (new make spirit) every year[1] which is used in a number of different whiskies. The distillery has won various awards for its products including a double gold awarded to the 17 year old Single_Malt at the San Francisco_World_Spirits_Competition[19] and a gold for the 15 year old Scottish oak wood finish for \"best wood finish\" by the Stockholm Beer and Whisky Festival.[19] Glengoyne 17 year old was voted World\'s Best Single Highland Malt in the \"Best of the Best\" whisky tasting, organised by \"Whisky Magazine\".[20] Due to the rapid growth recently of the Scotch malt whisky industry (recent figures indicate a 9% growth in 2002[9]) and of the premium whisky market as a whole,[9] Glengoyne is mainly marketed in the UK, Scandinavian, French, German and USA markets.[21][22] <i> Current Range[edit] </i> Range\nAged\nCask Finish[23]\nAwards[23]\n10 years\nGold at 2007 San Francisco\nWorld Spirits Competition\n12 years\nDouble Gold at 2005 San\ncask_strength\nFrancisco World Spirits\nCompetition\n* Double Gold at 2003\n&amp; 2005 San\nFrancisco World\nSpirits Competition Core\n* Gold at 2007 San Single_Malt\n17 years\nFrancisco World\nSpirits Competition\n* Best of the Best by\nWhisky Magazine\n* Gold at International\nSpirits Challenge\n1999, 2005\n21 years\nGold at 2005 San Francisco\nWorld Spirits Competition\n32 years\nN/A Limited Edition\n16 years\nGlenguin Shiraz Cask Single_Malt\n15 years\nScottish Oak wood\nGold at 2005 Stockholm Beer\n&amp; Whisky festival <i> Past range[edit] </i> Range\nAged\nCask Finish[23]\nNumber of Bottles[23]\n11 years\nEuropean Oak Sherry\n301\nSingle cask\nHogshead 2008 Rare Bottlings\n16 years\nRefill Hogshead\n287 Single_Malt\nSingle cask\n19 years\nOloroso Hogshead\n262\nSingle cask\n14 years\nAmerican Oak Sherry\n296 2007 Rare Bottlings Single cask\nHogshead Single_Malt\n20 years\nSpanish Oak Sherry Butt\n592\nSingle cask Range\nAged\n21 years\nSingle cask\n29 years 2006 Rare Bottlings\nSingle cask Single_Malt\n36 years\nSingle cask\n16 years\nSingle cask miniature\n19 years\nSingle cask\n32 years\n2005 Rare Bottlings\nSingle cask\nSingle_Malt\n37 years\nSingle cask <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ a b c d e f g \"Glengoyne _Scotch_malt_whisky_distillery_profile\".\nMaltMadness.com.

The distillery was owned by Chivas Brothers Ltd, best known for their Chivas_Regal blended scotch whisky. It is the world\'s second&#8211;biggest single malt whisky brand. Glen Grant was purchased[1] by the Italian company Gruppo_Campari in December 2005.

In 1840, brothers John and James Grant decided to take out a license. With the sea and port of Garmouth_nearby, the River_Spey at its feet and barley&#8211;growing plains nearby, all the basic ingredients of malt whisky were close at hand. This time the distillery was legal. By 1872, the founders of Glen Grant Distillery had died. Young James\nMajor\nGrant, born in 1847, had always taken a keen interest in the distillery and having inherited the business and the title\nGlengrant\nfrom his uncle John Grant, he was to prove himself a worthy successor. Glen Grant Distillery Stories about\nThe Major\nabound. A legendary innovator, socialiser and traveller, he lived by his own rules and set his own standards. New ideas fascinated him and he wasn t afraid to explore them. He was the first man in the Highlands to own a car. Glen Grant was the first distillery to have electric light. And he introduced the tall slender stills and purifiers which created the fresh malty flavour and clear colour that defines Glen Grant whisky to this day. In 1931, Major Grant, the last Glengrant, died, survived by his three daughters and a distillery that had become one of the most famous in the world. Douglas MacKessack, his grandson, was to become his successor. In 1972, the Glenlivet and Glen Grant Distilleries Ltd amalgamated with the blending concerns of Hill, Thomson and Co.Ltd and Longmorn Distilleries Ltd to become The Glenlivet Distillers Ltd. The original family interest in the distilleries was maintained, with two substantial outside shareholders: Courage Ltd, the brewing concern and Suntory Ltd, the Japanese distilling company. In 2006, Campari acquired Glen Grant, its only whisky, when Allied Domecq was acquired by Pernod_Ricard. To this day, Glen Grant continues to be one of the biggest selling single malts worldwide. <u> Distillery Managers till Date[edit] </u> Date\nManager Pre&#8211;1898\nGeorge_Grant 1898 &#8211; 1941\nJames_Cumming 1941 &#8211; 1969\nJames_Smith 1969 &#8211; 1983\nErnest_Sherret 1983 &#8211; 1992\nDennis_Malcolm 1992 &#8211; 1996\nWillie_Mearns 1996 &#8211; 2005\nRobert_Mac_Pherson 2005 &#8211; 2006\nHamish_Proctor 2006 &#8211; current Dennis_Malcolm <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* Scotch_whisky <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ \"Business_|_Italy\'s_Campari_seals_whisky_deal\".

Mitchell had previously been involved with Springbank_Distillery but following a quarrel with his brother John, with whom he owned Springbank, he first joined his other brothers at Reichlachan distillery before venturing out on his own. In 1919 the distillery was sold as a result of the post&#8211;war economic downturn which was badly affecting all the distilleries in the Campbeltown Region. In 1924 the distillery changed hands again and by 1925 had ceased production with all remaining stock being sold off. After being used as a rifle range, an attempt to reopen the distillery by Maurice_Bloch, who, with his brother, also owned the Glen_Scotia distillery, failed due to Second World War as did a second attempt by Campbell Henderson Ltd. in the 1950s. <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_Renovation\n* 2_Production\n* 3_References\n* 4_External_links <u> Renovation[edit] </u> In late 2000 the company of Mitchell\'s Glengyle Ltd. was formed with the express purpose of renovating and rebuilding the Glengyle distillery. Mitchell\'s Glengyle is associated with the Springbank Distillery, and both operations come under the guidance of Mr. Hedley Wright, a descendant of the Mitchell Family, the original owners of both businesses. Over the next four years the buildings were repaired to an adequate standard, being restored in line with the local area and the buildings\' listed status (protected by law). Since the original distillery equipment had been disposed of in the 1920s, new stills, malt_mills, a mash_tun and washbacks were installed along with all the related equipment. In reality much of this was not new, coming instead from other distilleries which had either ceased production or had surplus equipment. <u> Production[edit] </u> Production at the new Glengyle distillery began in 2004 with the first spirit expected to be ready by 2014. Glengyle is the first new distillery of the millennium and is part of a trend in new distilleries which include Arran (1995), Daftmill (2005) and Islay\'s newest distillery, Kilchoman (2005). The whisky from the new Glengyle distillery will not be called Glengyle, rather it will be bottled under the name Kilkerran. This is because the name is owned by Loch Lomond Distillers, and used for their vatted_malt. The name Kilkerran comes from the Scottish_Gaelic: Ceann Loch Cille Chiarain (\"head of the lake of Saint_Kieran\'s cell\"), the name of a settlement where Saint Kieran is believed to have had a religious cell and where modern Campbeltown stands today. <u> References[edit] </u>\n* Stirk, David (2005).

When it opened in 1958, it was the first new distillery to open in Speyside since the great whisky crash of 1898.[1] It therefore contrasts markedly with Strathisla &#8211; the oldest in Scotland. Construction started in 1957 on the site of a meal&#8211;mill and was completed in 1960, initially with three stills with the intention of triple distillation. In 1970, two more stills were added when production was switched to double distillation. The new production method incorporated the novelty of the first gas&#8211;fired stills in Scotland. Three years later, steam coils were also installed. The output of the distillery was originally used in blends such as Chivas Regal, Passport and 100 Pipers but Chivas Brothers also used it as a laboratory for experiments with innovations in production and processing, for example developing their own strains of yeast. In the 1990s[when?] the distillery released an official bottling under the name Glen Keith 1983. This bottling was replaced a few years later[when?] by a 10 year old single malt. It also produced[when?] two peated malts under the names Glenisla and Craigduff. The Glen Keith distillery was mothballed in 1999. Extensive reconstruction work began in 2012 and the distillery was reopened in June 2013.[2] At the time of the distillery\'s reopening, Chivas Brothers intended that its annual production would be six million litres of spirit, almost all of which would be used in blended whiskies destined for export.[1] <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ a b Rankin, Jennifer (15 June 2013). \"It\'s_whisky_galore_again_on\nSpeyside_as_distillery_reopens_after_15_years\".

It is the oldest legal distillery in the parish of Glenlivet, and the production place of the Scottish_whisky of the same name. It is described in packaging and advertising as \"The single malt that started it all\". It was founded in 1824 and has operated almost continuously since.[1] The distillery remained open throughout the Great Depression and its only closure came during World_War_II. The Glenlivet distillery has grown in the post&#8211;war period to become one of the biggest single malt distilleries in order to keep up with global demand; The Glenlivet brand is the biggest selling single malt whisky in the United_States and the second biggest selling single malt brand globally.[2] Today, the distillery is owned by the French alcoholic beverages company Pernod Ricard and they oversee the distillery\'s production of 5,900,000 proof litres per annum.[3][4] The majority of this\nenough for 6 million bottles\nsold as The Glenlivet single malt, with the remainder being used in Pernod Ricard\'s blended_whisky brands.[2] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_Production\n* 2_History\n* 3_Extension\n* 4_Products\n* 5_Awards_and_Reviews\n* 6_See_also\n* 7_References\n* 8_External_links <u> Production[edit] </u> The distillery draws water from Josie\'s Well and other springs a short distance from the distillery. The barley comes from Crisp Maltings, Portgordon. Lastly, Glenlivet\'s stills are lantern shaped with long, narrow necks, all of which helps to produce a light tasting spirit.[5] The distillery has 4 wash stills each with a capacity of 15,000 litres and 4 spirit stills with a capacity of 10,000 litres.[6] Spirit from the distillery is then matured in oak casks formerly used to mature bourbon (ex&#8211;bourbon), as is normal throughout the industry, with some products being finished in casks previously used to store sherry and port.[5] Glenlivet is categorised as a Speyside_distillery. The Glenlivet range consists of 12 Years, 15 Years, 16 Years N durra, 18 Years, 21 years, and 25 years, with a number of limited edition whiskies such as the Cellar Collection.[7] Glenlivet also produces a range for the travel retail and duty&#8211;free_shop markets, which differs slightly from the normal range.[8] The main product range from the distillery is The Glenlivet range of single malt scotch whisky, but whisky from the distillery is also used in the production of Pernod Ricard\'s other brands, including Chivas_Regal and Royal Salute_whisky brands.[9] Bottling of The Glenlivet took place at a Chivas Brothers bottling plant at Newbridge just outside of Edinburgh,[6] but that plant was sold at the end of 2009 with bottling to be transferred to other Chivas Brothers plants.[10] In 2008, The Glenlivet announced expansion plans for the distillery to keep up with increased demand. This includes the installation of a new mash_tun, new stills and new wash backs.[11] <u> History[edit] </u> Illicit distilleries were commonplace throughout the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant with the passing of the Excise Act, in 1823.[12] It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander_Gordon,_4th_Duke_of_Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit.[9] This would prove to be an unpopular decision, every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery.[9] In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.[1][13] George Smith established a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm&#8211; Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and were unable to meet rising demand.[1][13] The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed around the same time to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858.[1] Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed at the same time and the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George &amp; J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.[1][13] George Smith died in 1871 and his son John Gordon Smith inherited the distillery. The quality of the product from their distillery had resulted in the other distilleries in the area renaming their products to \"Glenlivet\" and by the time of George\'s death, several distillers were doing so. J.G. Smith decided to take legal action and tried to claim ownership on The Glenlivet name, this legal action was only partially successful &#8211; the verdict forced other distillers in the area to stop calling their whisky Glenlivet and gave J.G. Smith and the blender Andrew Usher sole permission to use the brand, but permitted other distilleries to hyphenate their distillery name with the \"Glenlivet\" name, which resulted in new distillery names such as The Glen Moray&#8211;Glenlivet Distillery, a distillery which is situated nearby.[1][13] The distillery remained open throughout the Great_Depression, an event which affected many other distilleries; it wasn\'t until the Second_World_War that the distillery was mothballed for the first time, by Government decree.[1] In the aftermath of World War Two, Britain was heavily indebted and needed to export large quantities of goods to earn foreign revenue (mainly United_States dollars). Distilling was an ideal industry with whisky much in demand overseas. Distilling restrictions were rapidly lifted and output from the distillery was at pre&#8211;war levels by 1947, despite ongoing barley, fuel, and manpower limitations.[1] Bread rationing was retained until 1948 in order to ensure supplies of grain for the distilleries.[1][14] Glenlivet Distillery (George &amp; J.G. Smith, Ltd.) merged with the Glen_Grant Distillery (J. &amp; J. Grant Glen Grant, Ltd.) in 1953 to form The Glenlivet and Glen Grant Distillers, Ltd.. The company would go on to merge with Hill Thomson &amp; Co., Ltd. and Longmorn&#8211;Glenlivet Distilleries, Ltd. in 1970 before changing their name to Glenlivet Distillers Ltd in 1972.[13] The company was then purchased by Canadian drinks and media company Seagram in 1977.[2] Seagram\'s alcohol production interests were acquired by Pernod_Ricard and Diageo during 2000, with ownership of Glenlivet Distillers passing to Pernod Ricard.[3] Glen Grant Distillery was sold to Campari_Group in 2005.[15] The Glenlivet is the best selling malt whisky in the United_States, and the fourth best selling in the UK with a 7% market share. The Glenlivet is the world\'s second best selling single malt whisky, and current global sales total 6 million bottles per annum.[2] <u> Extension[edit] </u> A new extension with an additional mashtun, eight washbacks and 6 stills was opened by the Prince of Wales on 5 June 2010.

Between 1985 and 1989, production was suspended and the distillery closed; it was then reopened and in 1992 started producing a Mannochmore single_malt. In 1996 the black Loch Dhu (\"Black Loch\" in Scottish_Gaelic) single malt whisky was introduced, and has been gaining market favour despite (or because of) the rather unusual appearance and taste. After a brief re&#8211;closure in 1995, the distillery only produces for twelve months and then has a break of twelve months alternating with the nearby Glenlossie distillery, with which it shares the employees. [1] [2] [3] As of 2008, Mannochmore distillery has been operated year round by its own crew of employees,[4] though the (in)famous Loch Dhu has not been made since 1999. <u> Production[edit] </u> The water of the region Speyside, which the distillery belongs to, comes from Bardon Burn. The malt is purchased from Castle Head Maltings in Elgin. The distillery has one mash_tun (12 tonnes), eight washbacks (54,000 l), three washstills (14,400 l) and three spirit_stills (17,000 l). The distillery works run on steam.

The distillery is owned by The Glenmorangie Company Ltd, whose main product is the range of Glenmorangie single malt whisky. Glenmorangie is categorised as a Highland_distillery and boasts the tallest stills in Scotland.[3] It is available in Original, 18, and 25 year old bottlings, special cask bottlings, cask finishes, extra matured bottlings, and a range of special edition bottlings. The Glenmorangie Company also owns the Ardbeg_Distillery on Islay and The_Scotch_Malt_Whisky_Society based in Leith, Edinburgh.[4] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Production\n* 3_Pronunciation\n* 4_Current_products\n* 5_Accolades\n* 6_In_popular_culture\n* 7_References\no 7.1_Notes\no 7.2_Bibliography\n* 8_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> Legend tells that alcoholic beverages of one kind or another were produced in and around Tain since the Middle_Ages.[5] It is said that the production of alcohol started at Morangie Farm in 1738, when a brewery was built that shared the farm\'s water source, the Tarlogie Spring. A former distillery manager, William Matheson, acquired the farm in 1843 and converted the Morangie brewery to a distillery, equipped with two second hand gin stills.[3] He later renamed the distillery Glenmorangie. The distillery was purchased by its main customer, the Leith firm Macdonald and Muir, in 1918.[6] The Macdonald family would retain control of the company for almost 90 years.[3] Glenmorangie, like all distilleries and breweries in Britain suffered terribly between 1920 and 1950, with prohibition and then the Great_Depression in the United States reducing whisky sales. The distillery was effectively mothballed between 1931 and 1936. The depression ended with World_War_II, but the war effort left fuel and barley in short supply and the distillery was again mothballed between 1941 and 1944.[6] Exports of whisky were important during the war, but enemy action disrupted and destroyed deliveries to the United States and Canada. Towards the end of the war and in the immediate post war period, the distillery increased production and was running at full capacity by 1948. The number of stills was increased from two to four during 1977. Water supply became a concern during the 1980s with development of the land around the Tarlogie Springs becoming more likely. This development could have reduced the quality and quantity of water available to the distillery, so the decision was made by Macdonald and Muir to purchase around 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land around and including the Tarlogie Springs to guarantee the quality and quantity of water necessary. The distillery once again engaged in expansion during 1990 when it added a further four stills, and two additional fermentation vessels (or washbacks) were added during 2002. Four new stills were added in 2009, bringing the total to twelve.[3] The Macdonald family retained ownership of 52% of the company through a complicated London_stock_exchange listing which saw the family hold the majority of the voting shares of the company. In 2004, the then shareholders sold the company to the French drinks company Mo t_Hennessy_Louis_Vuitton for around\nmillion.[7][8] Following the change of ownership, Tayburn design agency were appointed to redesign Glenmorangie as part of a brand overhaul. This included the introduction of a new, more curvaceous bottle, and the renaming of some of its variants. Its Wood Finish whiskies were given new names such as The Quinta Ruban, Nectar d\'Or and LaSanta, which were also advertised as non chill&#8211; filtered for the first time. Commentators have observed that the redesign appears to re&#8211;position Glenmorangie as an international luxury brand. According to Professor Paul Freathy, the director of the Institute of Retail Studies at the University of Stirling, \"The French&#8211;sounding (?) names are an unusual innovation, because what makes whisky unique is the traditional tie to Scotland. It\'s a brave strategy.\"[9] According to the Tayburn design agency, \"Following the acquisition of Glenmorangie, parent company LVMH made clear their strategy to move the brand into the world of luxury. We have been working on a number of projects to reflect this \'new world\' positioning. Our work continues to challenge traditional perceptions of whisky branding, introducing Glenmorangie to a modern, luxury fraternity.\"[10] For some years, The Glenmorangie Company supplied its whisky for the production of \"own brand\" blended whisky by supermarket groups.[11] This ceased in 2009 when it sold off the Glen_Moray brand. Glenmorangie has been the best selling single malt in Scotland almost continuously since 1983, and produces around 10 million bottles per annum, of which 6 to 6.5 million are sold in the UK.[12] Globally, Glenmorangie has a 6% share of the single malt market.[13] <u> Production[edit] </u> The stills which stand 26 ft (7.9 m) high Glenmorangie\'s water source is the Tarlogie Springs, situated in the Tarlogie Hills above the distillery.[6] Barley grain is supplied by Highland Grain Ltd, a co&#8211;operative of farmers in the area.[14] The stills used, the tallest in Scotland at 26 ft 3 in (8.00 m) tall, with 16 feet 10.25 inches (5.1372 necks,[15] are claimed by the company to produce an extremely light taste.[16] The distillation process is undertaken by a staff of 16, known as The Sixteen Men of Tain, who work year round, with the exceptions of Christmas and periods of maintenance.[3] Casks maturing at The Glenmorangie Distillery Glenmorangie uses a number of different cask types, with all products being matured in white oak casks which are manufactured from trees growing in Glenmorangie\'s own forest in the Ozark_Mountains of Missouri, United States. These new casks are left to air for two years before being leased to distillers Jack_Daniel\'s and Heaven_Hill for them to mature bourbon in for four years. Glenmorangie then uses their barrels to mature their spirit. The Original range will mature entirely in ex&#8211;bourbon casks, while the Extra Matured range of bottlings are transferred into casks that were previously used to mature other products such as wine, port or sherry in a process called finishing. These form part of the regular range of products Glenmorangie produces. Glenmorangie also obtains small batches of other casks for finishing and release limited edition bottlings from these. Following acquisition by LVMH, Glenmorangie produced a rare limited edition aged in casks previously used to mature Ch teau_Margaux; these bottlings are now (2011) extremely hard to find and are priced accordingly.[17][18] The warehouses in which the casks are stored are also believed to affect the taste of the whisky. Glenmorangie have released a special edition bottling, titled Cellar 13 which is from the warehouse closest to the sea, as the whisky is believed to have a distinctive flavour.[19] Bottling of the Glenmorangie and Ardbeg brands takes place at The Glenmorangie Company\'s purpose built bottling plant in The Alba Campus at Livingston,_West Lothian, just outside Edinburgh, Scotland.[20] Glenmorangie previously bottled Drambuie in a joint venture with the Drambuie Company; this arrangement ended in 2010.[21] <u> Pronunciation[edit] </u> The name of the whisky is / i/ glen&#8211;MORR&#8211; n&#8211;jee,[22] with the stress on the \'mor\' and rhyming with orangey, not */ GLEN&#8211;mor&#8211;AN&#8211;jee as it is commonly mispronounced.[citation_needed] <u> Current products[edit] </u>\n* The Original (10 Years Old)\n* Lasanta (Sherry Cask Extra Matured)\n* Quinta Ruban (Port Cask Extra Matured)\n* Nectar D\'Or (Sauternes Cask Extra Matured)\n* Astar (exclusively matured in Designer casks)\n* Artein (Super Tuscan Extra Matured)\n* Dornoch\n* Finealta (exclusively matured in American white oak casks and Spanish\nOloroso sherry casks)\n* Ealanta (19 Years old, exclusively matured in virgin American white oak\ncasks)\n* Sonnalta PX (10 years In American white oak casks and 2 years in Spanish\nex&#8211;Pedro Ximenez casks)\n* Companta\n* Signet\n* Extremely Rare (18 Years Old)\n* The Quarter Century (25 Years Old)\n* Pride 1981 (18 years in oak casks and 10 years in Sauternes barriques\n* Pride 1978 [23] <u> Accolades[edit] </u> Glenmorangie\'s products have tended to garner very high scores from international Spirit_ratings competitions and from liquor reviewing bodies. Its 12&#8211;year Lasanta and 18&#8211;year single malt spirits, for example, have never received less than a silver medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competitions.[24] The 12&#8211;year Lasanta has been placed in the Top 10 percentile of all whiskies by Proof66.com, which aggregates liquor ratings from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and others.[25] Over the last 5 years Glenmorangie has won more \'Gold Best in Class\' awards than any other single malt Scotch whisky from the International Wine and Spirits Competition.[26] In 2012, the IWSC awarded The Glenmorangie Company the title Distiller of the Year. Glenmorangie Quarter Century won Best Highland Single Malt at the 2013 World Whisky Awards.[27] <u> In popular culture[edit] </u>\n* Jazz_fusion guitarist Allan_Holdsworth released an album named The\nSixteen_Men_of_Tain in 2000.[28]\n* In the 1986 film Highlander, Connor_MacLeod orders Glenmorangie in a bar\nwhile following Brenda_Wyatt. <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ http://www.maltmadness.com/whisky/glenmorangie.html\n2. ^ The translation of \"Glen of Tranquillity\" implied by Glenmorangie\ncommercials is derived from the similarly sounding Gleann M r na S\n\"great valley of peace\"; at least this was the explanation given in\nreaction to a 2003 complaint to the Scottish Advertising Standards\nAuthority about the alleged mistranslation ASA.org.uk\n3. ^ a b c d e \"Glenmorangie_Single_Malt_Scotch_Whisky\".

Following a fire and extensive rebuilding program at their Aberlour_Distillery, the company focused on production of Aberlour whisky, allowing the Glen Moray distillery to run down. It was closed in 1910. The distillery was purchased by the owners of the Glenmorangie Distillery, the MacDonald and Muir families at some time during the 1920s. The distillery received 2 additional stills in 1958 and at present has an annual capacity of around 2,000,000 litres. The company now belongs to La Martiniquaise which uses part of its production in their blended Whisky Label 5. The distillery was expanded in 2012 and now produces 3,300,000 litres annually from 3 wash stills and 3 spirit stills. <u> Visitor Centre[edit] </u> The distillery has a visitor centre which offers tours all year round, and also has a cafe serving home bakes, snacks and Illy coffee. <u> Awards and Accolades[edit] </u> Glen Moray has been entered into the International Wine and Spirits Competition for several years now and has won a variety of Gold, Silver and Bronze awards including Gold Beset in Class for the non aged Glen Moray Classic.

The distillery won awards for the best single malt at the International_Wine_and Spirit_Competition in 1994 and 1996, and at the Monde_Selection in 1996 and 1997.[1] However, IWSC and Monde Selection awards are non&#8211;competitive and only products that pay to enter are judged. <u> History[edit] </u> In the mid&#8211;1200s the MacKenzies of Ord were granted lands in the west of Scotland by King_Alexander_III. In 1820 Thomas MacKenzie of Ord inherited the estate embarked on rejuvenating the area. A large portion of MacKenzie\'s land was devoted to the cultivation of barley, as such he decided to lease the land for a distillery to be built, this would also provide year round employment for local men.[4] At the time there were nine small licensed distilleries operating in the area to compete with, the majority of which were being run by ten&#8211;twelve of the tenant_farmers. The whole of the barley crop was used in the distilleries as it was the fastest way of turning it into funds with which to pay the rent. Water from Loch nam Bonnach and Loch nan Eun flowed to two large water_wheels from which the distillery derived its power. The water for the mashing was taken from a well known as the Cuckoo Well.[4] In its early days the distillery operated under the name of the Ord Distillery Company. It employed 18 people and was founded in 1838 by licence holders Robert Johnstone and Donald MacLennan, who both eventually went bankrupt in 1847. In spite of bankruptcy, the distillery continued to operate illegally for a few years before they received another licence under new owners, Alexander McLennan and Thomas McGregor, in 1855.[5] By the time of McLennan\'s death in 1870, Glen Ord was sold throughout the British_Colonies, including places as far as Singapore and South_Africa. His widow married Alexander MacKenzie, a bank clerk from Beauly, who took over running the distillery in 1877. Upon taking over the enterprise, McKenzie constructed several new buildings which were burnt down soon afterwards.[5] In 1880, he began marketing and selling some of Glen Ord under the name of Glen Oran.[4] In 1896, MacKenzie sold the distillery to James Watson &amp; Son, whisky blenders of Dundee, who purchased the enterprise for\n15,800. The company had previously acquired three other distilleries as they were primarily invested in selling blended high quality whiskies, particularly Watson\'s_No._10.[4] With the onset of World_War_I in 1917 the distillery was closed, along with a number of other similar businesses, by the government in order to preserve barley for food supplies. The distillery reopened after the war in 1919. However, the Watsons sold the company only four years later to Thomas_Dewars &amp;_Sons of Perth, who amalgamated with the Distillers_Company. They in turn, sold the distillery again in 1930 to Scottish Malt Distillers, a subsidiary company of Distillers Company Ltd.[4] The distillery closed its doors for a second time in 1939 due to World_War_II. They did not open again until 1946. Three years later, the distillery installed electrical wiring for the first time into the building, giving up the use of paraffin_lamps. In 1958 the distillery went through another major change when the Meal mill closed. In 1961 the distillery ceased the use of their floor maltings and began using new saladin_boxes. Five years later they greatly expanded production by tripling the number of coal&#8211;fired stills from two to six, outifitting them with steam&#8211;heated coils. They continued improvements in 1968 by constructing large mechanical floor maltings next to the distillery that could meet the needs of not only their operation but seven other Scottish Malt Distillers. Glen Ord, however, continued to use their own saladin boxes until 1983.[4] In 1985 DCL, including its subsidiary Scottish Malt Distillers, merged with Guinness. The resultant grain and malt distilling enterprises were organised under the name of United_Distillers_Ltd. In 1997 Guinness and Grand Metropolitan merged to form Diageo, with head offices in London.[4] In 2001 the distillery began using Biobed_Modular_Plant technology to treat wastewater with low chemical_oxygen_demand (COD) loads. The distillery was the first company in the United_Kingdom to adopt such technology.[6] Today the distillery continues to produce Glen Ord whisky for Diageo, which includes the whisky in Dewar blends and Diageo s \"Hidden Malts\" series.[5] The distillery offers public tours throughout the year with hours on a seasonal schedule.[7] Glen Ord also doubles their distillery capacities by a big new building with several new wash and spirit stills in 2014. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d \"Glen_Ord_Distillery\".

The Glenrothes is owned by Berry_Brothers_and_Rudd, after being bought from the Edrington_Group in 2010.[1] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_Production\n* 2_Character\n* 3_History\n* 4_References\n* 5_External_links <u> Production[edit] </u> The Glenrothes is different from many other single malts in that since 1993[2] the bottlings are not determined by age but by vintage. The Glenrothes is also sold as \"Select Reserve\", a recently introduced non&#8211;vintage line. The Glenrothes is mainly matured in Spanish ex&#8211;Sherry casks, and some ex&#8211; Bourbon casks.[3] Special bottlings include \"Single_Cask\" bottles, which are taken from one single cask of whisky from a particular year. In the late 1980s, a few years before Glenrothes Distillery decided to bottle The Glenrothes as vintages, some casks of whisky prior to 1974 were left to mature together. These casks were bottled as a 30&#8211;year&#8211;old Glenrothes. Only 1134 bottles were produced. <u> Character[edit] </u> The house style is a warming, mouth&#8211;coating creamy spirit, with the classic Speyside \"pear drop\" character[citation_needed]. Thanks to its ageing and production, Glenrothes whisky is known for its spicy, rich character. Critic Michael_Jackson describes the house style as being \"Perfumy, sweet, spicy&#8211; fruity. After Dinner\".[4] <u> History[edit] </u> The distillery was built in 1878 by James Stuart &amp; Co, who then also worked the nearby Macallan distillery. The first whisky ran off the stills on the 28 December 1879, the same day as the Tay_Bridge disaster.[5] The distillery itself had a shaky start and a chequered history. Over&#8211;proof whisky is notoriously highly flammable and the distillery has paid the price. Extension work began in 1896 on a second malt kiln, and an increase in stills from two to four but, before the work was finished, a fire in December 1897 caused serious damage. The distillery saw further damage with a serious explosion in 1903. Then, in 1922, a fire in Warehouse Number One caused the loss of 200,000 imperial gallons (910,000 L) of whisky. Another fire in 1962 afforded the opportunity for expansion and a further re&#8211;build in 1982 extended the still hall to five wash stills and five spirit stills.[6] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Scotchmaltwhisky.co.uk (2010). \"Edrington_To_Buy_Cutty_Sark_Brand\".\nLondon.\n2. ^ Page 139, Malt Whisky Yearbook 2010.

Situated in Campbeltown (the Victorian Whisky Capital of the World) the distillery has a formidable pedigree. Campbeltown is a small town on the Kintyre peninsula on the west coast of Scotland, affectionately known as the\nWee Toon , and, remarkably for a town of its size, still has 3 operating distilleries; Glen Scotia, Springbank, Glengyle. These distilleries give a remarkable insight into the history of making whisky in this remote, once prolific, whisky making region of Scotland. Glen Scotia was formally known as \'Scotia\' when it was first founded in 1837 by Stewart &amp; Galbraith and Company. Stewart &amp; Galbraith Co. ran the Distillery for almost 60 years. Notable industrialist Duncan MacCallum purchased the distillery in 1891 and he constructed the large frontage (Malting Floors) which run horizontally across High Street which is a street in Campbeltown. It was then bought by Loch Lomond Group who own it to this day. The start of the new century was a period of upheaval for the whisky industry in Campbeltown and all of Scotland. The First World War, prohibition and over production all conspired to weaken demand. Glen Scotia currently operates with a staff of just five employees making it one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland. The current annual production levels stand at around 250,000 liters. <u> Product Range[edit] </u> Glen Scotia revamped its line in early 2013 and extended its official bottling range to 10yr, 12yr, 16yr, 18yr and 21yr. In addition to this, they updated their packaging with a range&#8211;wide graphic of a long haired Highland Cow under the northern lights, each year differentiated by a different colour scheme. Also, the entire range is now bottled at a heftier 46% ABV. <u> Equipment[edit] </u> Glen Scotia has 1 Wash Still and 1 Spirit Still and 6 Stainless Steel Washbacks. The washbacks that Glen Scotia originally had were more than 40 Years Old and were made out of Corton Steel <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ Brander_1996, p. <i> Bibliography[edit] </i>\n* Brander, Michael (1996).

Glen Spey distillery was built in 1878 by James Stuart &amp; Co. under the name \'Mill of Rothes\'. It actually started its life as an oatmeal mill &#8211; founder James Stuart was a corn merchant before he ventured into the whisky world. The distillation equipment was simply added to the existing mill in the years before the Glen Spey distillery was sold to the Gilbey company of London in 1887. It expanded production capacity from two to four stills in 1970. Glen Spey (along with Glenlossie and Strathmill) continues to use \'purifiers\'. Purifiers act as small condensers, returning a proportion of the alcohol vapours back to the pot to be re&#8211;distilled. So, this would increase the amount of \'reflux\' within the pot stills. This results in a lighter spirit. During its history, the distillery has released only a handful of official bottlings. The distillery\'s product is currently primarily used for J&amp;B products. </string>

[4] When Alfred Barnard visited the distillery he described the valley as\nperfect paradise to artists, who come in great numbers to transfer some of its transcendant beauties to canvas.\n[5] The distillery is located in the parish of Monzievaird and Strowan.[6] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Production_and_Character\n* 3_Towser_the_Mouser\n* 4_Illicit_Distilling\n* 5_References\n* 6_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> The distillery was officially established in 1775, but the distillery had previously been under the control of illicit distillers, who sought to avoid paying taxes to England, since 1717. [7] This early history has led to claims that Glenturret is the oldest distillery in Scotland, a title contested by other establishments such as Littlemill, [8] Glenisla,[9] Bowmore [10] and Glen Garioch. [11] The distillery was originally known as\nHosh\nand was originally owned by the Drummond family. \"Hosh\" comes from the gaelic \"cois\", meaning foot. [12] It was taken over by John McCallum in 1845 till 1875 when Thomas Stewart took it over and renamed it Glenturret in its centenary year. [13] The First World War saw the closure of the distillery, but following the war it reopened again under the Mitchell Brothers until 1921 when the great depression and prohibition in America saw it closed again.[14] The buildings during this period were kept as storage by the Murrays of Ochtertyre. It did not reopen again to production till 1957 when it was revitalised by James Fairlie. [15] [16] Fairlie was a whisky enthusiast and his intention was to create a malt whisky created in traditional fashion and to preserve the craft of distilling. [17] The distillery was bought by Cointreau in 1981 and from there passed to Highland_Distillers in 1990.[18] Since then it has become the home of\nFamous Grouse Experience , [19] which was nominated for an Interactive Entertainment Award at BAFTA in 2002. [20] <u> Production and Character[edit] </u> The water supply for the Glenturret comes via its own pipeline from Loch Turret which has its origin in Ben_Chonzie. As the water used contributes much of the taste and character of the whisky, the purity and quality of the water is essential in the whisky making process. Ben_Chonzie is part of the Grampian Mountain Range and is a granitic intrusion, [21] with a diorite composition. This geology has resulted in the extreme softness of the water of Loch Turret making it a suitable source for the whisky. Barley is soaked in water from the source for two to three days then spread over the floor of the malting_house. The green malt is then dried in a kiln over peat smoke. The malt is then milled into grist, which is like a course flour. Grist is then mixed with hot water in the mash tun at about 70 C for about an hour. This is drained off and the second water, which is hotter, is added and allowed to run straight through. The third water is even hotter and is used as the first water for the next batch. The sugary wort is collected, cooled and then fermented in large pine vessels called wash backs. Yeast is added and after 48 hours of fermentation the wash is made. The wash is then pre&#8211;heated in a wash&#8211;charger and from there goes to the wash still. This is a traditional pot still made of copper and is of a shape unchanged in the history of Scotch_whisky making. The wash is heated in the pot still so the alcohol vapour rises up and cools and condenses in the low wines receiver. The low wines then passes through to the spirit still where it is distilled again. The spirit running through the pot and spirit stills is subject to Her Majesty Customs and Excise Duty and so is kept under lock and key. It can be sampled and tested by the stillman via the spirit sample safe. The spirit from the spirit still is divided in three parts, but only the middle cut or\nHeart of the Run\nis suitable to be made into malt_whisky. The other two parts are fed back into the low wines receiver to be re&#8211;distilled. The middle cut then goes to an oak spirit receiver and from there to the filling vats in the spirit store. [22] At this stage more water is added to reduce the concentration of alcohol from 75% to 64%. Each oak cask is handmade and therefore unique, so each must be weighed before and after filling to determine how much spirit is in each. Each cask is stencilled with the name, year, cask number and number of litres. The casks are then laid aside in the warehouse for a minimum of three years when it can be used for blending. But for the malt_whisky range it is matured for 8, 10, 12, 15 or 21 years or longer for very special bottlings. [23] Philip Hills has described Glenturret with the words:&#8211;\nIts nose has the floweriness which is characteristic of such [bourbon cask]; it opens up with water and yields scents of elderflower and liebfraumilch. It is entirely honest, not appearing to be anything it isn t, but what it is, is sufficient; an entirely pleasing and agreeable whisky.\n[24] <u> Towser the Mouser[edit] </u> Towser, a long&#8211;haired tortoiseshell female, the resident feline pest control expert at Glenturret from 1963 till 1987 [25] was an officially recognised record breaker. Her record breaking victim count was estimated as 28,899[26] mice, which were laid out on the Still House floor each morning to be inspected by the stillman. The auditors for the Guinness_book_of_records observed Towser\'s prowess over a number of days and her total kill count was estimated statistically. She was commemorated by a bronze statue at the visitor\'s centre at Glenturret and her story was featured on Blue_Peter. Her paw prints also decorate the label on a bottle of Fairlie\'s light Highland Liqueur. [27] Her successors are Dylan and Brooke [28] who were chosen for their friendliness and photogenic looks rather than for their mousing skills. <u> Illicit Distilling[edit] </u> Excise duty was introduced in Scotland in 1660. [29] The taxation laws were very complex and it was unclear how much tax should be paid. Duties also continued to rise gradually and Robert_Burns wrote the poem \"Earnest Cry and Prayer\" in 1785 about the problems these high duties caused. Burns himself was an exciseman between 1789 and 1796. [30] He was reported to be \"not a bustling active gauger\" and was allegedly too impatient for the lengthy stake&#8211;outs required in his investigations. [31] But the job paid very well and there were often sizeable rewards paid and the job had very good security. In 1814 the act banning the use of stills of less than 500 gallons was introduced. [32] This limited whisky production to commercial concerns and from then on farmers had no way of raising enough money to pay their rents, as distilling allowed them to use their excess grain for whisky which could be sold at a profit greater than that of the grain itself. This drove many honest people to smuggling as a way to survive. Many widespread difficulties were caused by farmers moving off the land, that agriculture in the Highlands was in danger of dying out. The law was changed in 1816 to allow stills of more than 40 gallons to be legal to encourage small distillers.[33] However this still meant that stills under 40 gallons were determined to be portable and hence illegal which eradicated a lot of domestic distilling. Smuggling gangs set up stills in secret places. The stills themselves were small so that if the exciseman was spotted they could be removed and hidden. Smuggling chiefs were often men of high standing in the community. When one of their men was arrested the chief\'s name would be kept secret. This was partly due to the fact that the excise duties were seen as a tax by a foreign power, i.e. England, and so denying this revenue was their patriotic duty. [34] There are many tales of the deviousness of the whisky smuggler in outwitting the gaugers (an itinerant exciseman who measured containers and their content), [35] and the excisemen. In one such story the gaugers confiscate a large cask of spirit and transport it to a nearby inn where they are staying. They take the cask to their room on the second floor for safe keeping. The smugglers came to the inn and employ the serving girl to locate where the cask sits on the floor above and using an auger bore into the bottom of the cask, removing all the spirit so that there is none left for the gaugers to sample. The only way to tackle the illegal distilling entirely was to decrease the duty so that it was no longer profitable and increase policing so that the military and gaugers were increased. Revenue cutters were employed up and down the coast and the numbers excisemen was increased as they were often out numbered by smuggling gangs. [36] Further tariff reforms and generous rewards for informers were introduced and these measures became known as \"the burning and starving act\". [37] Illicit distilling has died out from lack of profitability, but rumours still persist in remote places of homemade moonshine like \"Melvaig Mist\" and in Shropshire.

The distillery was built in 1871 to replace Tochineal Distillery but liquidated in 1903. Buckie Council purchased the concern in 1936 and ownership was transferred to Arthur_Bell_&amp;_Sons_Ltd in 1938 and indeed to this very day the Bell\'s logo is used in the advertising of Inchgower. The current operator of Inchgower is Diageo. As of 1966 Inchgower has operated four stills. The distillations of Inchgower contribute a major component of Bell\'s blended whisky. The Inchgower is classified as a Lower_Speyside_Malt and takes its water from a burn rising in the Menduff Hills to the south of Buckie.\n* v\n* t\n* e Whisky_distilleries_in_Scotland Scotch_whisky\n* Glen_Scotia Campbeltown\n* Glengyle\n* Springbank\n* Aberfeldy\n* Balblair\n* Ben_Nevis\n* Blair_Athol\n* Clynelish\n* Dalmore\n* Dalwhinnie\n* Deanston\n* Edradour\n* Fettercairn\n* Glen_Garioch Highland\n* Glen_Ord\n* Glencadam\n* Glengoyne\n* Glenmorangie\n* Glenturret\n* Loch_Lomond\n* Lochnagar\n* Oban\n* Old_Pulteney\n* Teaninich\n* Tomatin\n* Tullibardine\n* Wolfburn\n* Abhainn_Dearg\n* Arran\n* Barra\n* Blackwood Island\n* Highland_Park\n* Isle_of_Jura\n* Scapa\n* Talisker\n* Tobermory\n* Ardbeg\n* Bowmore\n* Bruichladdich Islay\n* Bunnahabhain\n* Caol_Ila\n* Kilchoman\n* Lagavulin\n* Laphroaig\n* Ailsa_Bay\n* Annandale Lowland\n* Auchentoshan\n* Bladnoch\n* Daftmill\n* Glenkinchie\n* Aberlour\n* Ardmore\n* Auchroisk\n* Aultmore\n* Balmenach\n* Balvenie\n* Benriach\n* Benrinnes\n* Benromach\n* Brackla\n* Braeval\n* Cardhu\n[Glenmorangie_Distillery_Stills.jpg]\n* Cragganmore\n* Craigellachie\n* Dailuaine\n* Dufftown\n* Glen_Elgin\n* Glen_Grant\n* Glen_Moray\n* Glen_Spey\n* Glenallachie\n* Glendronach Speyside\n* Glendullan\n* Glenfarclas\n* Glenfiddich\n* Glenglassaugh\n* Glenlivet\n* Glenrothes\n* Glentauchers\n* Inchgower\n* Kininvie\n* Knockando\n* Knockdhu\n* Linkwood\n* Longmorn\n* Macallan\n* Macduff\n* Mannochmore\n* Mortlach\n* Speyburn\n* Strathisla\n* Speyside\n* Tamdhu\n* Tamnavulin\n* Tomintoul\n* Tormore\n* Cameronbridge Grain\n* Girvan\n* North_British\n* Strathclyde\n* Ballechin\n* Banff\n* Ben_Wyvis\n* Brora\n* Caperdonich\n* Dallas_Dhu\n* Finnieston\n* Glenflagler\n* Glenugie\n* Glenury\n* Hazelburn Closed or\n* Imperial mothballed\n* Kinclaith\n* Ladyburn\n* Littlemill\n* Lochside\n* Millburn\n* North_Port\n* Parkmore\n* Pittyvaich\n* Port_Charlotte\n* Port_Ellen\n* Rosebank\n* St._Magdalene\n* [Category] Category\n* [Commons page] Commons\nThis article about a company of Scotland is a stub.

The distillery fell into disrepair, but in the 1960s two local estate owners Robin Fletcher and Tony Riley&#8211;Smith rebuilt the distillery, employing architect William Delme&#8211;Evans.[2] By 1963 their work was complete; they had introduced taller stills allowing the distillery to create a mix of malts. In 2006, the whisky received a Gold Quality Award from the international quality institute Monde_Selection.[3] <u> Products[edit] </u> A single malt from the Jura distillery packaged and aged by an independent bottler.\n* \"Origin\" is a ten year old whisky. This lightly peated malt is made from\na selection of aged Jura single malt whiskies.\n* \"Diurachs\' Own\" is sixteen years old.\n* \"Superstition\", a single malt \"lightly peated with hints of smoke.\"\n* \"Prophecy\" is a heavily peated malt, bottled without chill filtration. In\nthe early 1700s the Campbells of Jura evicted a man who prophesised that\nthe last Campbell to leave the island would be one&#8211;eyed with his\nbelongings carried in a cart drawn by a lone white horse. In 1938 Charles\nCampbell, blind in one eye from a war injury, fell on hard times and led\nhis white horse to the old pier for the last time.[4][5] <u> Community[edit] </u> While the red deer population rests at around 5,000, the number of people who make their living on this island sits at less than 200. The inhabitants of Jura are known as Diurachs, which is their Gaelic name. The key dates in the Diurach calendar include the whisky festival\nFeis Ile. [6] This runs throughout the last week in May each year across both Islay and Jura. The Jura Music Festival takes place every year in September.[7] Begun in 1994, the traditional music festival runs for three days. The annual Sports Day takes place on the Ardlussa Estate each July[8] and the Jura Regatta is held annually in the summer.[9] <u> The Diurach Programme[edit] </u> Visitors to the distillery are offered a free dram (3.7 mL) for life, every month at the Jura pub, as part of the Diurach promotional programme.[10] <u> The Island[edit] </u> The Isle_of_Jura is seven miles (11 km) wide and thirty miles (48 km) long and it has only one road, one pub and one distillery. There are seven estates on Jura: Ardfin, Inver, Jura Forest, Ruantallain, Tarbert, Ardlussa, and Barnhill. <u> Getting to Jura[edit] </u> \"Extremely unget&#8211;at&#8211;able\" were George_Orwell\'s words on describing how to reach Jura. The island is as awkward to reach today as it was in 1946. The journey from London involves two flights and a boat. From March to October there is a passenger ferry from Tayvallich on the west coast of Scotland.[11] Most travellers to Jura go by CalMac car ferry from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula to Islay, and then cross to Jura from Port_Askaig on Islay by the MV Eilean_Dhiura, a small vehicle ferry which is run by ASP Ships on behalf of Argyll_and_Bute_Council. Islay can also be reached by air: Islay_Airport is served by daily flights from Glasgow. <u> Brand ambassadors[edit] </u> In 1975 Willie Tait began a lifelong association with the island. He has worked as a tunroom man, mash, stillman under manager, distillery manager and master distiller, and is now Global Brand Ambassador. In 2011 he was awarded a lifetime Achievement Award from the Malt Advocate magazine (USA)[12] for his 37 years\' service to the Scotch_Whisky_industry. Willie Cochrane started his career at the Jura distillery as a Mash/Still Operator in 1976. Soon after, he was promoted to the dual role of Brewer and Engineer. After thirty years, he became Jura Distillery Manager. <u> Awards[edit] </u>\nThis section does not cite any references_or_sources.

First cask of Kilchoman single malt whisky It is one of only six Scottish distilleries still doing traditional floor&#8211; maltings, and will be unique in having all parts of the process &#8211; growing barley, malting, distilling, maturing and bottling &#8211; carried out on Islay. The distillery first filled casks on 14 December 2005 and the distillery began bottling 3 year old single malt in September 2009. Kilchoman also intends to release 5, 8, 10 and 12 Year old bottlings. The whisky will primarily age in bourbon casks, though sherry casks will also be employed.[2] The first official Kilchoman, the \"Inaugural release\" was released in 2009 and the first 100% Islay whisky released in 2011. The whisky produced by the Port Ellen maltings are peated to the same levels as Ardbeg, while the malt peated on their own floor maltings will be approximately 25 ppm.[4] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Islay_whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* Whisky <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Morrice, Philip.

Whilst featuring computer controlled distillation, it lacks its own mash_house. Mash houses are responsible for producing the liquid needed for fermentation in the washbacks, so the liquid used by the Kininvie Distillery in their washbacks was piped from the Balvenie distillery some 200 metres away.[1] The distillery operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to meet demand.[1] Almost all of its whisky was used in the blended whiskies of William Grant &amp; Sons. Kininvie was closed in 2010, when Grant\'s Ailsa_Bay distillery became operational. The distillery has, to date, released only two single_malt whiskies, the first a limited edition bottling called Hazelwood 105, which was bottled aged 15 years.,[3] the second being the Hazelwood Reserve released for the 107th birthday of Janet Sheed Roberts as a 17&#8211;year&#8211;old. The output from the Kininvie Distillery is normally used in William Grant &amp; Sons blended whiskies, primarily the Clan MacGregor blended_whisky, a typical blended whisky featuring a high percentage of grain_whisky mixed with the single malt from the Kininvie Distillery.[4] William Grant &amp; Sons, in 2005, introduced a premium blended_malt_whisky called Monkey Shoulder, which is created from a mixture of single malt from Kininvie, together with single malts from the Balvenie and Glenfiddich distilleries, both of which are owned by William Grant &amp; Sons.[5] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland\n* William_Grant_&amp;_Sons\n* Glenfiddich\n* Balvenie <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d Sutherland, Andy. \"Kininvie\".

Knockando Distillery was built by John Tytler Thomson in 1898, and is named after the village in which it stands. The name derives from Scottish_Gaelic Cnocan Dubh, meaning \"Little Black Hill\". The village is home to a few other small houses and the larger Knockando House, and is surrounded by woods in which there are buzzards, Red Squirrel and Roe Deer. In 1904 the distillery was purchased by W &amp; A Gilbey, a gin producer from London, becoming part of J&amp;B / Grand Metropolitan in the 1960s and 1970s, and is now owned by multinational firm Diageo. Knockando was the first distillery in Scotland to be built with electric lighting. In 1905 it was linked directly to the Great_North_of_Scotland Railway, which connected Grantown&#8211;on&#8211;Spey with the main towns of north&#8211;east Scotland. Cottages for distillery workers were built nearby, as well as a house for the Customs_and_Excise Officer. The distillery currently lies near the disused Tamdhu Station, very close to the beginning of the Speyside_Way. The railway has long since been dismantled. Knockando Distillery is home to a famous selection of casks which went into the J_&amp;_B_Ultima blend in 1994 to celebrate the quincentennary of Scotch Whisky. This blend contained 128 different whiskies (116 Malt &amp; 12 Grain) and 1 of each of these casks is still maturing in the Warehouse.

The distillery was founded in 1893 by John Morrison, who bought the land from the Duke of Fife[citation_needed] to produce whisky for Haig\'s after several springs on the southern slope of Knock Hill were discovered.[1] The site was also chosen for its proximity to the Knock Station on the Banff branch line of the Great_North_of_Scotland_Railway (GNSR) between Aberdeen and Elgin.[citation needed] Not only was the new location convenient to the railway but it was also within a few miles of a district noted both for its barley and inexhaustible source of excellent peat.[citation_needed] The distillery was built using local eye grey granite, with two steam heated stills.[1] The two pot_stills could turn out 2,500 gallons of spirit per week.[citation_needed] It was also the first malt distillery built for the Distillers Company Ltd. It started production in 1894 and remained in continuous operation until 1931, when it was forced to close for a few years due to the economic depression. Wartime restrictions on barley forced a second closure from 1940&#8211;1945.[2] After the war, with the distillery connected to the national grid, the steam powered engine, which had been used since the its founding, was retired in 1947.[citation_needed] Knockdhu was closed in 1983, and was sold to Inver House in 1988,[1] after which production resumed in February 1989. Various bottling ages are available the most popular being 12 years old, there is also an annual vintage bottled around 14 15 years old, a 16 year old (matured solely in second fill bourbon casks) and a 30 year old. Previously named Knockdhu after the distillery, the whisky was renamed anCnoc in 1994 to avoid confusion with Knockando.[3] Knockdhu Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky is currently bottled under the Gaelic name anCnoc meaning \"the hill\". <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

(April 2012) The distillery of Lagavulin officially dates from 1816, when John Jonston and Archibald Campbell constructed two distilleries on the site. One of them became Lagavulin, taking over the other which one is not exactly known. Records show illicit distillation in at least ten illegal distilleries on the site as far back as 1742, however. In the 19th century, several legal battles ensued with their neighbour Laphroaig, brought about after the distiller at Lagavulin, Sir Peter_Mackie, leased the Laphroaig distillery. It is said that Mackie attempted to copy Laphroaig\'s style. Since the water and peat at Lagavulin\'s premises was different from that at Laphroaig\'s, the result was different. The Lagavulin distillery is located in the village of the same name. Lagavulin is known for is slow distillation speed and pear shaped pot_stills. The two wash stills have a capacity of 11,000 Liters and the two spirit stills of 12,500 Liters each.[1] <u> Accolades[edit] </u> Lagavulin Distillers Edition International Spirit_ratings competitions have generally given Lagavulin\'s 16&#8211; year spirit extremely high scores. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition, for instance, gave the 16&#8211;year four consecutive double gold medals between 2005 and 2008 and has awarded it gold medals in the years since.[2] Wine_Enthusiast put the 16&#8211;year in its 90 95 point interval in 2004.[3] Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and others, classifies the spirit in its highest (\"Tier 1\") performance category.[4] <u> Managers[edit] </u>\n* Alistair Robertson 1984 1988\n* Grant Carmichael 1988 1995\n* Mike Nicolson 1995 October 1998\n* Donald Renwick 1998 2005\n* Graham Logie 2006 2008\n* Peter Campbell 2008 2010\n* Georgie Crawford 2010 <u> In popular culture[edit] </u> Lagavulin was referenced on an episode of NBC\'s The_West_Wing titled \"Dead Irish Writers\" as the preferred scotch of the character, Lord_John_Marbury.

It is named for the area of land at the head of Loch Laphroaig on the south coast of the Isle of Islay. The meaning of the toponym is unknown but a commonly suggested derivation implies the elements \"lag\" (Gaelic: hollow), \"breid\" (Norse: broad) and \"vik\" (Norse: bay), implying an original Gaelic form something like \"Lag Bhr dhaig\" (the hollow of Broadbay). The name may be related to a placename on the east coast of Islay, aig\", again suggested as meaning \"broad bay\". The distillery and brand are owned and operated by Beam_Suntory, the American subsidiary of Japan\'s Suntory Holdings.[2] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Taste\n* 3_Friends_of_Laphroaig\n* 4_See_also\n* 5_References\no 5.1_Notes\no 5.2_Bibliography\n* 6_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> The Laphroaig distillery was established in 1815 by Donald and Alexander Johnston.[3] The Johnstons who founded Laphroaig were from the Clan Donald and are likely to be from the MacIain of Ardnamurchan branch of the clan. The family anglicized their name to Johnston.[3] The last member of the Johnston family to run the distillery was Ian Hunter, a nephew of Sandy Johnston, who died childless in 1954 and left the distillery to one of his managers, Bessie Williamson. The distillery was sold to Long John International in the 1960s, and subsequently became part of Allied_Domecq.[4] The brand was in turn acquired by Fortune_Brands in 2005, as one of the brands divested by Pernod_Ricard in order to obtain regulatory approval for its takeover of Allied Domecq. Fortune Brands then split up its business product lines in 2011, forming its spirits business into Beam Inc. Beam was then purchased by Suntory_Holdings in April 2014. Laphroaig has been the only whisky to carry the Royal_Warrant of the Prince_of Wales, which was awarded in person during a visit to the distillery in 1994. The 15&#8211;year&#8211;old was reportedly the prince\'s favourite Scotch whisky. <u> Taste[edit] </u> A distinctive \"pagoda\" style kiln chimney at Laphroaig Laphroaig calls itself one of the most strongly flavoured of all Scotch whiskies, and is most frequently aged to 10 years, although the 15&#8211; (now discontinued) and 18&#8211;year&#8211;old varieties are common (the 27&#8211;, 30&#8211; and 40&#8211;year&#8211; olds are rare and expensive). The whisky has a peaty/smokey flavour. The Laphroaig Quarter Cask was introduced in 2004. This expression is aged in smaller casks and is not chill_filtered. Due to the smaller barrels used, the oak surface contact is 30% greater than with standard barrels. The company describes the effect of this as \"creating a soft and velvety edge\".[4] The Quarter Cask is bottled at 48% ABV (96 proof).[5] The standard bearer 10&#8211;year&#8211; old bottling is bottled at 43% ABV.[5] <u> Friends of Laphroaig[edit] </u> In 1994 the Friends of Laphroaig Club was established, members of which are granted a lifetime lease of 1 square foot (930 cm2) of Laphroaig land on the island of Islay. The annual rent is a dram of Laphroaig which can be obtained upon visiting the distillery.[6] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ John Butler. \"Pronunciation_of_Scotch_Whiskys\".

The distillery was built in 1821 by Peter Brown with two stills, and started production in 1825 with a capacity of 4,500 litres per year.[1][2] [3] The distillery was operated by James Walker until Browns death in 1868, after which the distillery got under control of his son, William Brown.[4] Between 1872 and 1873 William Brown, the son of Peter Brown designed and built a new distillery with help of architect Methven, replacing the old one on the same location.[1][4] The new distillery had a capacity of 227,000 liters per year.[2] After William Browns death, the Linkwood&#8211;Glenlivet company was created by Browns family in 1898 and brought to the stock exchange.[3] The distillery was then further extended to a capacity of 454,000 liters per year.[2] In 1902 Innes Cameron joined the Linkwood&#8211;Glenlivet company and became managing director of the Linkwood distillery until his death in 1932. By that time he was the largest shareholder of the company.[2] The company was sold to Scottish Malt_Distillers, which itself was bought by United_Distillers. After temporary closure between 1941 and 1945 as a result of barley shortage during the World_War_II, the distillery reopened in 1945 under Roderick Mackenzie, who led the distillery until 1963. Mackenzie who believed that all things in the distillery contributed to the final product. In 1962, Scottish Malt Distillers decided the distillery needed to be completely refurbished. Mackenzie oversaw the rebuilding of the distillery in his last year as general manager. The distillery was electrified, replacing the steam engine and water wheel that powered the distillery before, and all stills were replaced with exact replicas of the former stills.[4] In 1971 the a second distillery was built alongside the first, which became known as Linkwood B, with steam heated stills. The stills of the first distillery were converted by heated by steam as well.

Duff was a former manager of the Glendronach Distillery and the Bon Accord Distillery in Aberdeen, and was the founder of the Glenlossie Distillery, as well as being involved with unsuccessful distilleries in Cape_Town and the USA. Longmorn Distillery started production in December 1894. Three years later John Duff built the Benriach Distillery next to Longmorn, but both were affected by the collapse of wholesale buyers Pattison, Elder and Co. in 1898. Duff was ruined by the collapse, and Longmorn Distilleries Company Ltd. passed through a variety of ownerships. In 1970, Longmorn joined The_Glenlivet and Glen_Grant to form The Glenlivet Distillers Ltd. This was bought by Chivas Brothers in 1978, and in 2001 Chivas Brothers was acquired by the French Pernod_Ricard Group. <u> Reviews[edit] </u> The Longmorn 16&#8211;year expression has received warm reviews at international spirit_ratings competitions.

The Macallan Distillers Ltd, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Edrington_Group which purchased the brand from Highland_Distillers in 1999.[1] In 2009, The_Herald reported that Macallan was \"the world s third largest&#8211; selling single malt (behind Glenfiddich and Glenlivet) with over 500,000 cases a year, and second largest by value\".[2] The_Scotsman published a quote from Ken Grier on 16 August 2009, stating: \"We have now overcome Glenfiddich to move into the second biggest selling single malt by volume behind Glenlivet\".[3] In 2011, Edrington Group reported that prior&#8211;year sales of The Macallan were up 8% to over 700,000 cases and the BBC also reported that an office was being opened in New York to continue growth in the American market.[4] Since the Scotch_Whisky_Regulations_2009 came into force labelling of bottles of Scotch whisky has been regulated. Under the regulations, the \"Speyside\" designation can only be used by distilleries in certain wards (but not Craigellachie) in the traditional Speyside region. Despite this, whisky authorities (among them the writer Michael_Jackson) typically consider The Macallan a notable Speyside Single Malt. Currently produced bottles of The Macallan indicate it is a Highland_Single_Malt, while the website for the brand indicates that The Macallan s stills are the \"smallest on Speyside.\"[5] Originally, The Macallan was matured only in oak sherry casks brought to the distillery from Jerez, Spain. Beginning in 2004, The Macallan introduced a new main product, the Fine Oak series, with the whisky mellowed in bourbon oak casks as well as sherry ones.[6] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_Bottlings\n* 2_Publicity_and_marketing\n* 3_See_also\n* 4_References\n* 5_External_links <u> Bottlings[edit] </u> The distillery produces a number of expressions in its core Sherry Oak series, the most generally available being the 12&#8211;year&#8211;old, although the 18&#8211;year&#8211;old is widely distributed, alongside a 10&#8211;year&#8211;old cask strength expression at 58% ABV. Expensive 25&#8211; and 30&#8211;year&#8211;old versions can also be found. More recently, starting in 2004, The Macallan for the first time started to offer single malt expressions vatted with whisky matured in used casks other than ex sherry casks as part of the Fine Oak range. Macallan also markets special scotches in duty&#8211;free_shops at airports such as the 1824 Collection. Many rare, special releases and other small production run bottlings also exist. <u> Publicity and marketing[edit] </u> In 2001, Michael_Martin selected The Macallan 10 Years Old as the official Scotch of the Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons, even though Martin himself had given up drinking alcohol. He did smell whiskies to make his selection. This selection continued the tradition of the Speaker designating an official single malt.[7] In 2003, The Macallan started laboratory tests to determine if some antique whiskies purchased for their collection were forgeries, perhaps generated by a dealer with mafia ties.[1] In 2004, it was revealed that laboratory testing had determined at least 11 bottles in its antique whisky collection were fakes.[8] Although The Macallan had tested the paper of the labels and were satisfied the whiskies were genuine, additional tests on the contents of some bottles revealed whisky believed to be only 10 years old. David Cox, director of fine and rare whiskies for The Macallan, said, \"As a result of these tests from now on no antique bottles from the antique collection held at the distillery will be made available for sale.\" In 2007, a bottle of 1926 The Macallan was sold at a Christie\'s auction for $54,000, making it one of the most expensive bottles of liquor ever sold.[9] In 2010, a bottle of The Macallan 64&#8211;year&#8211;old single malt whisky in a one&#8211;of&#8211;a&#8211; kind \"Lalique: Cire Perdue\" crystal decanter was sold for $460,000 at an auction at Sotheby\'s in New York City. All proceeds from the sale were donated to charity:_water, an organization that helps provide access to clean, safe drinking water to people in developing nations.[10] In 2012, The Macallan received the Guinness_World_Record for the most expensive whisky ever sold at auction. In the 2012 James_Bond film Skyfall, Bond and Silva are seen toasting (\"To the women we love\") with \"50&#8211;year&#8211;old Macallan,\" a reference to the Bond franchise\'s 50th anniversary. \"The Macallan\" is also thanked in the end credits for Skyfall. In 2014, a decanter of Macallan\'s \'M\' whisky sold at auction in Hong Kong for a record breaking $628,205.

Established in 1794, it was built before the town of the same name, which sprung up later in the surrounding craggy harbor.[2] Oban distillery is owned by Diageo. It has only two pot_stills, making it one of the smallest in Scotland, producing a whisky that has been described as having a \"West Highland\" flavour that falls between the dry, smoky style of the Scottish islands and the lighter, sweeter malts of the Highlands.[3] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Bottlings\n* 3_See_also\n* 4_References\n* 5_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> The distillery was built in 1794 by the brothers John and Hugh Stevenson and operated by them until 1866, when it was bought by Peter Curnstie. It was then acquired by Walter Higgin in 1883 and rebuilt. In 1898, Alexander Edward, who also owned Aultmore Distillery, bought out Higgin. In its first year of operation, it suffered major losses when a major blending company, Pattison\'s of_Leith, went under. In 1923, Oban was sold to Dewars and joined Distillers Company with that company in 1925. It fell silent from 1931 until 1937 and again from 1969 to 1972 when a new still house was built. In 1989 a new visitors\' centre was installed. <u> Bottlings[edit] </u> The Oban Distillery is primarily known for its 14&#8211;year&#8211;old malt, which is marketed as part of Diageo\'s \"Classic Malts Selection\" range, launched in 1988. Also available is a \"Distiller\'s Edition\" bottling, which is finished in a Montilla Fino sherry cask before bottling. There is also an 18&#8211;year&#8211;old limited edition and a rare 32&#8211;year&#8211;old edition. In December of 2014 Oban introduced a NAS (non&#8211;age&#8211;statement) bottling, called Oban \"Little Bay\". <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Classic_Malts_of_Scotland\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland\n* List_of_whisky_brands <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ John Butler. \"Pronunciation_of_Scotch_Whiskys\".

The distillery produces the Old Pulteney single&#8211;malt whisky at a number of ages and has a visitor_centre in Huddart Street. The distillery was established in 1826[1] in the name of Sir_William_Pulteney (who died in 1805), and for whom Pulteneytown is named. The distillery is the most northerly on the Scottish mainland and was quite inaccessible, except by sea, when established. Barley was brought in by sea, and the whisky was shipped out the same way. Many of the distillery workers were also employed as fishermen. The herring fishing industry is no longer part of daily life in Wick but the distillery continues to operate, producing a Highland single&#8211;malt with a reputation as one of the finest available. Characteristics of the whisky are attributed to exposure to sea_air during maturation.[1] The distillery closed in 1930 due to declining trade after the local parish enforced prohibition laws but re&#8211;opened in 1951 when the vote was rescinded after the law was abolished.[2] It is now owned by Inver_House_Distillers.[3] The Old Pulteney site uses water from an old mill stream called the Mill_Lade. This stream flows out of Loch_Hempriggs, 3 or 4 kilometres (2 miles) to the south/southwest, and is reputed to have powered a barley mill at or near the site of the distillery. The Old Pulteney 21&#8211;year&#8211;old single_malt whisky secured the top award and was named \"World Whisky of the Year\" in Jim_Murray\'s 2012 Whisky Bible. Runners&#8211;up were American bourbons George_T._Stagg and Parker\'s Heritage Collection Wheated Mash Bill.[2] In 2006 the 12&#8211;year&#8211;old malt was declared the best in its class with a gold award at the International_Wine_and_Spirit_Competition.[3] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b Pulteney_Distillery, Visit Scotland, archived from the original on\n19 June 2014, retrieved 19 June 2014\n2. ^ a b Wick_malt_named_world\'s_best_whisky, BBC_News, 24 October 2011,\narchived from the original on 19 June 2014, retrieved 19 June 2014\n3. ^ a b Rogerson, Paul (10 August 2006), \"Old_Pulteney_raises_spirits_at\nInver_House\", Glasgow_Herald, archived from the original on 19 June 2014,\nretrieved 19 June 2014 </string>

Scapa is the second most northern whisky distillery in Scotland, being half a mile farther south than the Highland_Park_Distillery. The distillery has one wash still and one spirit still producing a single_malt (unblended) whisky. It is an especially honey flavoured whisky, and less peaty than most Island Whiskies. This is because, though the water at the source is peaty, it gets transported to the distillery through pipelines to avoid more contact with the peat. Furthermore, the malt is not dried over peat smoke. The distillery, founded in 1885 by Macfarlane &amp; Townsend, was during the 1950s acquired by Hiram Walker &amp; Sons Ltd (now part of Pernod_Ricard) and rebuilt. In 1994 it was mothballed, and faced definitive closure in 2004. During that period, the most commonly available edition was the Scapa 12 years old, which was and still is a most distinctive island whisky for its subtle heathery honey plus sea taste. Still, it was decided to rebuild/restore the distillery, and the first new spirit in 10 years flowed in November 2004. Because of the time&#8211;gap, it was decided to stop the 12 years and introduce the 14 years, which is quite different from its predecessor, even though the basic characteristics are intact. The 14&#8211;year expression of the Scapa offering has been given fair&#8211;to&#8211;good reviews at international spirit_ratings competitions. It won gold and double gold medals at the 2005 and 2008 San_Francisco_World_Spirits_Competitions, but received a more modest score of 85 (on a 100 point scale) in 2005 from the Beverage Testing Institute.[1] In November 2009 Scapa was re&#8211;launched as a 16 years old whisky, with an extra two years in first fill American oak casks.

The site was chosen by John Hopkins himself for its unpolluted water supply from the Granty_Burn, one of the major tributaries to the River_Spey. Hopkins appointed the famous distillery architect Charles C Doig to design the distillery and to this day Speyburn has its classic pagoda ventilator, a hallmark of Doig\'s design. The proprietors, keen to have production started to ensure that the first fillings could bear the date 1897 &#8211; Queen_Victoria\'s Diamond Jubilee &#8211; had scheduled production to begin on 1 November 1897. However, due to delays, the stills did not run until 15 December. When production finally began, the still house was without doors and windows. Under the watchful eye of the distillery\'s manager, John Smith, the first spirit was run off in a violent snow storm with the distillery men working in overcoats and mufflers to protect them from the elements. However, the proprietors succeeded in achieving their ambition and one butt was produced and bonded bearing the date 1897.

It was built by hand by George Christie over the next decades, and was finished in 1987. It took another three years until whisky production started in 1990.[1] Two pot stills of traditional shape were installed. Because massive production was never one of George\'s objectives, they are some of the smallest in Scotland. The Glenspey mash tun was the very last fitted by Newmill engineering before they closed down. Though small the distillery can produce 500,000 litres of alcohol per annum. The distillery is the most southern on Speyside and takes its water directly from the River_Tromie.[2] <u> Products[edit] </u> The Speyside distillery offers many varieties of Scotch_whisky in addition to many other distilled spirits. Their ten&#8211;year single malt Scotch whisky is no longer produced, having been superseded by twelve and fifteen&#8211;year&#8211;old malts, whilst an unaged malt called Drumguish is also available.[2] It also produces malts under the names Glentromie and C\nDhub.[3] The company additionally produces various blended whiskies, including Glen Hood, Best Seller and Scottish Prince.

Its standard bottling\nis a 10 year old, distilled two and a half times, and is not chill&#8211;\nfiltered, nor does it have colour added. Distilling whisky two and a half\ntimes is quite unusual, as it means that during the distillation process\nsome of the low wines are collected before the second distillation, and\nthen mixed back into the feints for another distillation. This means that\nsome parts of the spirit have been through distillation twice and some\nparts three times. The spirit is then aged in ex&#8211;bourbon and ex&#8211;sherry\ncasks, although Springbank is experimenting with rum casks as well. The\nstandard 10 year old bottling is available at 46% volume. They also\nproduce a somewhat darker 15 year old and an 18 year old. A 21 year old\nvariety of Springbank exists, but is increasingly rare.\n* Longrow Single Malt is a highly peaty whisky. There is also an\nexperimental tokaji&#8211;cask edition available. Longrow won Best Campbeltown\nSingle Malt at the 2013 World_Whiskies_Awards.[2]\n* Hazelburn Single Malt, the newest variety, was first distilled in 1997\nand since bottled as an 10&#8211;year&#8211;old. In 2009 a 12&#8211;year&#8211;old variety was\nreleased. Hazelburn is a triple distilled, non&#8211;peated whisky, named for\nanother now&#8211;defunct Campbeltown distillery. <u> Production[edit] </u> Springbank is one of only two distilleries in Scotland to perform every step in the whisky making process, from malting the barley to bottling the spirit, on same premises: the other is Kilchoman_Distillery who also grow their own barley. While a few others still maintain the first step in the process, the malting of barley (which is becoming more rare), Springbank also bottles their own whisky. <u> Ownership[edit] </u> Springbank is one of the few remaining family owned distilleries. Nearly all of its whisky is sold as a single malt, with little of it finding its way into blends. Most blends are produced by larger conglomerates who tend to use the single malts from the distilleries that they own in their blends. Springbank produces two of its own blends, 5 year old Campbeltown Loch. <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u> <i> Notes[edit] </i>\n1. ^ \"Springbank_Whisky_&#8211;_Buy_Springbank_Whiskies_Online_&#8211;_Master_of_Malt\".\nRetrieved 2014&#8211;10&#8211;3.\nCheck date values in: |accessdate= (help)\n2. ^ \"Longrow_wins_Best_Campbeltown_Single_Malt_award\".

Unlike Keith\'s other two distilleries of Strathisla and Glen Keith, however, Strathmill is not owned by Chivas (part of the Pernod_Ricard group) but since 1997 by Diageo who operate it for the production of blends such as J&amp;B whisky. The site had originally been home to a corn mill, established by A. G. Johnstone as Strathisla Mills in 1823, but following a boom in the whisky industry between 1890 and 1899 it was converted into a distillery in 1891. Some of the buildings therefore date to before its whisky production days. It was during this era of high demand that some thirty other distilleries were constructed in the area. It was in 1895 when gin producers W. &amp; A. Gilbey bought the distillery that the name was changed from Glenisla&#8211;Glenlivet to its current name of Strathmill, the name deriving from the Gaelic word \'Strath\' meaning \"shallow valley\" and \"mill\" relating to its former use. Production equipment consists of two wash stills, two spirit stills and seven warehouses on site; five traditional dunnage warehouses and two racked warehouses. It has a production capacity of 1,800,000 litres of pure alcohol per year. <u> References[edit] </u> http://www.scotchwhisky.net/distilleries/strathmill.htm http://www.maltmadness.com/whisky/strathmill.html http://www.thedrinkingmansguidetoscotland.com/strathmill&#8211;distillery.html\n* v\n* t\n* e Whisky_distilleries_in_Scotland Scotch_whisky\n* Glen_Scotia Campbeltown\n* Glengyle\n* Springbank\n* Aberfeldy\n* Balblair\n* Ben_Nevis\n* Blair_Athol\n* Clynelish\n* Dalmore\n* Dalwhinnie\n* Deanston\n* Edradour\n* Fettercairn\n* Glen_Garioch Highland\n* Glen_Ord\n* Glencadam\n* Glengoyne\n* Glenmorangie\n* Glenturret\n* Loch_Lomond\n* Lochnagar\n* Oban\n* Old_Pulteney\n* Teaninich\n* Tomatin\n* Tullibardine\n* Wolfburn\n* Abhainn_Dearg\n* Arran\n* Barra\n* Blackwood Island\n* Highland_Park\n* Isle_of_Jura\n* Scapa\n* Talisker\n* Tobermory\n* Ardbeg\n* Bowmore\n* Bruichladdich Islay\n* Bunnahabhain\n* Caol_Ila\n* Kilchoman\n* Lagavulin\n* Laphroaig\n* Ailsa_Bay\n* Annandale Lowland\n* Auchentoshan\n* Bladnoch\n* Daftmill\n* Glenkinchie\n* Aberlour\n* Ardmore\n* Auchroisk\n* Aultmore\n* Balmenach\n* Balvenie\n* Benriach\n* Benrinnes\n* Benromach\n* Brackla\n* Braeval\n* Cardhu\n[Glenmorangie_Distillery_Stills.jpg]\n* Cragganmore\n* Craigellachie\n* Dailuaine\n* Dufftown\n* Glen_Elgin\n* Glen_Grant\n* Glen_Moray\n* Glen_Spey\n* Glenallachie\n* Glendronach Speyside\n* Glendullan\n* Glenfarclas\n* Glenfiddich\n* Glenglassaugh\n* Glenlivet\n* Glenrothes\n* Glentauchers\n* Inchgower\n* Kininvie\n* Knockando\n* Knockdhu\n* Linkwood\n* Longmorn\n* Macallan\n* Macduff\n* Mannochmore\n* Mortlach\n* Speyburn\n* Strathisla\n* Speyside\n* Tamdhu\n* Tamnavulin\n* Tomintoul\n* Tormore\n* Cameronbridge Grain\n* Girvan\n* North_British\n* Strathclyde\n* Ballechin\n* Banff\n* Ben_Wyvis\n* Brora\n* Caperdonich\n* Dallas_Dhu\n* Finnieston\n* Glenflagler\n* Glenugie\n* Glenury\n* Hazelburn Closed or\n* Imperial mothballed\n* Kinclaith\n* Ladyburn\n* Littlemill\n* Lochside\n* Millburn\n* North_Port\n* Parkmore\n* Pittyvaich\n* Port_Charlotte\n* Port_Ellen\n* Rosebank\n* St._Magdalene\n* [Category] Category\n* [Commons page] Commons <u> Strathmill (distillery)[edit] </u></string>

The distillery was rebuilt 1880 87 and extended in 1900. When a new lease for the distillery was negotiated with the chief of Clan MacLeod in 1892 the annual payment was to be\n23.12s and a ten&#8211;gallon cask of best&#8211;quality Talisker. It was rebuilt in 1960 after a stillhouse fire completely destroyed the distillery. The distillery operates five stills; two wash stills and three spirit stills. All the stills use worm tubs (condensing coils) rather than a modern condenser, which are believed to give the whisky a \"fuller\" flavour (itself an indication of higher sugar content). During this early period, the whisky was produced using a triple distilling method, but changed to the more conventional double distilling in 1928. Talisker was acquired by Distillers Company in 1925 and is now part of Diageo. After the 1960 fire, five exact replicas of the original stills were constructed to preserve the original Talisker flavour. In 1972 the stills were converted to steam heating and the maltings floor was demolished. Talisker s water comes from springs directly above the distillery via a network of pipes and wells. The malted barley used in production comes from Muir of Ord. Talisker has an unusual feature swan neck lye pipes. A loop in the pipes takes the vapour from the stills to the worm tubs so some of the alcohol already condenses before it reaches the cooler. It then runs back in to the stills and is distilled again. Talisker now has an annual output of three and a half million litres of spirit. Talisker was the favourite whisky of writers Robert_Louis_Stevenson and HV Morton. In his poem \"The Scotsman\'s Return From Abroad\", Stevenson mentioned \"The king o\' drinks, as I conceive it, Talisker, Islay, or Glenlivet.\" <u> Character[edit] </u> The malt used is peated to a phenol level of approximately 18 22 parts per million (ppm), which is quite high for a non&#8211;Islay single malt.[citation needed] Additionally, the water used for production, from Cnoc nan Speireag (Hawk Hill), flows over peat which adds additional peatiness to the whisky. The distillery began producing special bottlings of the whisky for connoisseurs in the early 2000s, with a 20 and 25 year bottling (where previously only a 10 year and 18 year were available). The 25&#8211;year bottling, despite being more expensive than the 20&#8211;year bottling, was distributed more widely. In 2007 Talisker 18 year old won \"Best Single Malt In The World 2007\" at the World Whiskies Awards.[1] <u> Bottlings[edit] </u>\n* Storm, a \"No age statement\" expression\n* 10 years, bottled off&#8211;site\n* 12 years, only available to Friends of the Classic Malts members\n* 18 years, unavailable in some areas\n* 20 years, limited run of 9,000 bottles\n* 25 years, limited run of 21,000 bottles\n* 30 years, limited run of 2,958 bottles\n* Distiller\'s edition, finished in ex&#8211;Oloroso Sherry casks\n* 57\nNorth, a bottling with 57% alcohol <u> Reviews and accolades[edit] </u> Talisker whiskies have generally performed very well at international Spirit ratings competitions and have won some acclaim from liquor review organizations.

Three separate episodes (\"Edinburgh\" in series 1, \"Paris\" in series 3 and \"Timbuktu\" in series 4) revolve around First Officer Douglas Richardson\'s attempts to steal 25&#8211;year aged Talisker whisky rightfully belonging to the wealthy regular passenger Mr Birling, and it is also mentioned in several other episodes. In the movie Charlie_Wilson\'s_War, a CIA agent gives US Rep. Wilson a bottle of Talisker, which is bugged and allows him to listen to the congressman\'s conversations. In Assegai by Wilbur_Smith, General Penrod Ballantyne\'s favourite whisky is Talisker. In The_Guns_of_Navarone by Alistair_MacLean, Talisker is mentioned as the preferred drink of the RAF S.A. Service officer, always kept in his filing drawer. In Hard Rain, a John_Rain novel, John Rain drinks it in the beginning while at a night club. <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ \"World_Whiskies_Awards_2007\".

The distillery was founded in 1897 by a group of assemblers, wishing to engage in the production of their own whisky. It quickly passed on into the hands of Highland_Distillers. The history of the distillery was fairly quiet, without changing owners, but still marked by a long dormancy between 1927 and 1947. Its production capacity was tripled between 1972 and 1975. The distillery has now 3 wash stills and 3 spirit stills. Its annual production of pure alcohol is 4 million gallons. Unlike its neighbors the Tamdhu distillery has no roof&#8211;shaped pagoda above its malt furnaces. This is one of the last distilleries to malt all of its barley on the spot by a mechanical saladin. The Tamdhu whisky is almost completely used for the production of blended whiskies, such as The_Famous_Grouse, J_&amp;_B and Cutty_Sark. Tamdhu\'s traditional single malt bottling does not mention its age, but a recent addition to its product line includes a 10&#8211;year&#8211;old distillery bottling. Other single malts are sold by independent_bottlers. It was announced that as of April 2010, the Tamdhu Distillery, belonging to the Highland_Distillers subsidiary of the Edrington_Group, was being closed and the plant shuttered. It was then sold to Ian MacLeod Distillers in June 2011, who recommenced production of single malt in May 2013.[2] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_Whiskies\n* 2_See_also\n* 3_Notes\n* 4_References\n* 5_External_links <u> Whiskies[edit] </u>\n* Tamdhu 40%\n* Tamdhu 10 years 40%\n* Tamdhu 18 years 43%\n* Gordon_&amp;_MacPhail : Tamdhu 8 years Macphail\'s Collection 40%\n* Dewar Rattray: Tamdhu 1990 Cask Strength 62.9%\n* Signatory Vintage : Tamdhu 1994 Collection Cask Strength 61%. <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* Ian_MacLeod_Distillers, the current owners\n* Highland_Distillers, the company that produces Macallan\n* Edrington_Group and William_Grant_&amp;_Sons, owners of Highland\nDistillers\n* Whisky\n* Scotch_whisky\n* List_of_whisky_brands <u> Notes[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d The_Scotsman_2009, 20 November.\n2. ^ a b BBC_News_2011, 29 June. <u> References[edit] </u>\n* The Scotsman (20 November 2009). \"Dram_shame_as_bosses_close_down\ndistillery_after_112_years\".

Ltd. built the Tamnavulin distillery in order to satisfy the growing demand from whisky blenders such as Whyte &amp; Mackay, Crawfords, and Mackinlay\'s. In 1993, Whyte &amp; Mackay became the owners of Tamnavulin when the company purchased Invergordon Distillers (the parent company of the Tamnavulin&#8211;Glenlivet Distillery Co. Ltd.) The purchase price of\n382 million also included the distilleries Bruichladdich, Isle_of_Jura, and Tullibardine. The Tamnavulin distillery was closed in May 1995. Ownership was transferred to Kyndal International in 2001, and then to the United Spirits division of United_Breweries_Group in 2007, operated by Whyte and_Mackay_Ltd. The distillery began operating once again in July 2007 after a major refurbishment with new automation and process control which was installed by Canongate Technology. <u> Operation[edit] </u> With its eight washbacks, six stills, and a Saladin_box to malt the barley, Tamnavulin is sufficiently equipped with modern distilling technology to produce four million liters of alcohol per year. To increase thermal efficiency, recently distilled spirit is used to heat incoming wash. The distillation water supply is stored in a subterranean reservoir. </string>

It was founded and built in 1817 by Hugh Munro on his estate of Teaninich_Castle.[1] Despite an initial difficulty of procuring barley whisky owing to a high demand from illegal distilleries, by 1830 Teaninich produced 30 times more spirit than it did at its founding.[1] At that point the Munro sold the distillery to his younger brother Lieutenant&#8211; General John_Munro. As an officer he spent most of his time in India, so he decided to rent the distillery out to Robert Pattison in 1850. The lease lasted to 1869 after which Munro leased it to John_McGilchrist_Ross.[1] Ross relinquished the lease in 1895, and in 1898 Robert_Innes_Cameron took a stake in the distillery, and Munro and Cameron renovated and extended the distillery, [1] investing\n10,000 in to the renovations.[2] In 1904 Cameron, who also owned stakes in Benrinnes, Linkwood and Tamdhu, took over the distillery completely. After Cameron died in 1933 the distillery was sold to Scottish_Malt Distillers.[1] The distillery suspended production between 1939 and 1946 due to barley shortages during World_War_II.[2] In 1970 the distillery was greatly expanded, and an entire new building with six new stills was taken in operation.[3] The four older stills remained in operation alongside the new stills. The old side of the distillery was then updated over the next decade. First, new installations for milling, mashing and fermentation were built in 1973, and in 1975 the distillery added a dark_grains plant, which produces cattle feed from the draff.[2] In 1984 the old side of the distillery was mothballed, and the new side followed the next year, temporarily ending production entirely.[2] The new side of the distillery resumed production in 1991. The old side didn\'t resume production, and was demolished in 1999.[3] In 2000 a mash_filter press was installed in the distillery, which is unique in Scottish malt whisky production; all other Scottish whisky distilleries use mash_tuns.[2] In April 2013 owner Diageo announced a new renovation of the distillery.[2] They also announced a new distillery with 16 new stills will be placed next to the old distillery. The new distillery is planned to have a different name than Teanininich, and produce a separate whisky. [4] The distillery mainly produces malts for blending, and it is used in Johnnie Walker_Red_Label. There are no official bottlings of the malt. Since 1992 a 10&#8211; year&#8211;old malt has been available in the flora_and_fauna series.[2] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d e Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

The distillery, which was formerly known as Ledaig, was founded in 1798 and has changed hands several times, having undergone a number of periods of closure. The only distillery on Mull, it is currently owned by Burn Stewart Distillers under CL_Financial. Its main product, Tobermory_single_malt, is used in the blends Scottish Leader and Black_Bottle. The distillery also produces a smaller amount of peated whisky, which remains known under the former name, Ledaig. <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Production\n* 3_See_also\n* 4_References <u> History[edit] </u> Tobermory Distillery The distillery was founded as Ledaig distillery in 1798 by John Sinclair,[1] ten years after the founding of Tobermory by the British Fisheries Society.[2] Sinclair had originally arrived in the village as a merchant dealing with soda ash from burning the locally available kelp. In April 1797, he applied for 57 acres to the south of the harbor in order to build houses and a distillery. Distilling had been banned in the UK since 1795 in order to save grain for the War_of_the_First_Coalition with France.[2] Although he was originally told to build a brewery instead, he remained with the original plan and additionally built a pier known as \"Sinclair\'s Quay\".[2] The current buildings were constructed during that first period of occupation, [3] and were licensed in 1823.[1] It was acquired by John Hopkins &amp; Co in 1890, and by Distillers_Company in 1916 before closing in 1930 following a drop in the demand for whisky due to ten years of prohibition_in_the_United_States. [4][5] The colourful houses of Tobermory village In 1972 it was reopened under the name of Ledaig Distillery (Tobermory) Ltd.[4] In May 1975, production had to stop for a month as storage space for the whisky had run out. The construction of a bonded_warehouse had been delayed, causing fourteen workers to be laid off in the duration.[6] This was followed by the distillery going into receivership, with it being purchased by the Kirkleavington Property Company in 1978,[4] it opened again between 1979 and 1981. In the 1980s,[2] the warehouses were sold off for conversion into flats, and as such maturation no longer takes place on site.[4] It closed again until 1989, and in 1991 it was purchased by Burn_Stewart_Distillers for\n600,000 plus\n200,000 for stock.[7] Burn Stewart Distillers were bought out by Trinidad based CL_Financial for 49 million in 2002, including the distillery at Tobermory and Deanston.[8] It remains the only whisky_distillery on the Isle_of_Mull, in the main village of Tobermory at the northern tip of the island.[1] Tobermory is known for the variety of colors that the houses of the shore front are painted in and for being the location of the children\'s television show Balamory.[9][10] The distillery itself is located at the foot of a steep hill,[11] at the head of the bay.[7] In 2012, during the driest summer for thirty years, the distillery was forced to halt production temporarily, to preserve the quality and consistency of its whisky. Early the following year, following several further months of unusually dry weather, there was another temporary halt to production. On each occasion, the water level in the small, private loch used to supply water to the distillery had dipped to such an extent that proper rainfall was needed to replenish it to a satisfactory level.[12] <u> Production[edit] </u> The Tobermory_Single_Malt is distilled from unpeated malted_barley and matured in oak casks for at least ten years.[3] A heavily peated whisky is also produced, but in small quantities, named Ledaig for the original distillery name.[7] The malts are used in a number of blends including Scottish_Leader and Black_Bottle.[1] The water for the distillery comes from a private loch near to the Mishnish lochs.[7] The branding had been confused under previous owners, with the Tobermory brand being used for both a single_malt and a blended whisky.[2] Production was upgraded in 1990, with the distillery becoming capable of producing a million litres of spirit a year. It uses a traditional copper domed cast_iron mash_tun, four washbacks made of Oregon_pine, and four spirit stills.[1] The whisky is matured in both former bourbon_whiskey and sherry casks.[1] Maturation takes place at the distillery at Deanston.[13][5] <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_whisky_brands\n* List_of_distilleries_in_Scotland <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d e f Wishart, David (2006).

Its whisky is of the Highland region. Although it is thought that whisky has been distilled on the site since the 16th century, when cattle drivers would buy from a local still,[1] the distillery was not established until 1897, under the name of Tomatin Spey Distillery Co Ltd. The company went bankrupt in 1906, and reopened under new ownership in 1909. After the liquidation of its owners in 1986, it was taken over by Japanese conglomerate Takara Shuzo and was renamed Tomatin Distillery Co Ltd. The distillery operated with only two stills until 1958. Starting at that time, they began to add stills to increase production capacity, eventually reaching production of twelve million litres of whisky per year during the 1970s. Although in 1987 Tomatin was referred to as the largest malt distillery in Scotland,[2] stills have been dismantled since the mid&#8211;1980s, bringing their total capacity to just over five million litres, though as of 2007, they were only producing 2.5 million litres. Around eighty percent of Tomatin\'s whisky goes into blended whisky, including its own brands of Antiquary and Talisman. The distillery, as of late, has been making an effort to bolster its name as a producer of single malts and is expanding its core range. In 2003, Tomatin\'s basic 10 year old malt was replaced by the 12 year old. In 2009, a 15 Year was added to the line&#8211;up, which also includes an 18 year old and a 25 year old. Other limited releases are often made, including a 30&#8211;year, a 40&#8211;year and single&#8211;cask offerings. Recently, the distillery has begun to produce a lightly peated single malt called Cu Bocan. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Wishart,_David (2006).

It produces a range of single malts of different ages, a peated malt, and a vintage malt. The distillery is owned and operated by Angus Dundee_Distillers, PLC, of London,_England, which also owns and operates the Glencadam_distillery. In 2009 Tomintoul entered the Guinness_Book_of_World_Records by producing the largest bottle of whisky in the world, containing 105.3 litres of 14 year old Tomintoul malt whisky.[1] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Production\n* 3_References\n* 4_External_links <u> History[edit] </u> It was founded in 1964 by the Glasgow whisky traders Hey &amp; Macleod and W. and S. Strong, which set up a working company, Tomintoul Distillery Ltd. Production, to manage the distillery[2] At its founding the distillery had one wash still and one spirit still.[3] The distillery was bought by Scottish and Universal Investment Trust in 1973 which doubled the production capacity by placing an extra pair of steam heated stills in the next year. That year, the distilleries 10 year anniversary, they also released the first bottling of their malt.[3][2] Scottish and Universal was sold on to Whyte_&amp;_Mackay (which was owned by Brent_Walker) in 1989. Whyte &amp; Mackay itself was bought by American_Brands in 1990, and in the same year, Tomintoul started selling a 12 year old bottling of its malt in a distinctively styled bottle.[2] The distillery itself was sold off to Angus Dundee in 2000, and under their management, the official bottling became the 10&#8211;year&#8211;old malt, sold in more conventional bottles.[2] The official bottling portfolio expanded in the next years, with a 16 year old malt in 2003 and a 27 year old malt in 2004. A year later in 2005 a 1991 peaty vintage was released under the name \'Old Ballantruan\', bottled at 50% ABV, followed by 12 year old finished on Oloroso butts, a vatting of unpeated and peated Tomintoul malts under the name \'Peaty Tang\', and a 1976 vintage, all released around[when?] 2008.[2] <u> Production[edit] </u> Tomintoul has two wash and two spirit stills, which are all steam heated, and have a total capacity of producing 3,300,000 litres of pure alcohol per year. It uses eight stainless steel washbacks, 4 larger and 4 smaller[quantify]. The water it uses for its whisky comes from the Ballantruan source.[2][4] Cooling water is drawn from two nearby ponds.[2] The distillery offers three ranges of malts. The Tomintoul brand is a single malt offered in the ages 10, 12, 14, 16, 21 and 33 years old. The 12 year old bottlings are available only in portwoord and oloroso finishes, the others have no special finishes. It also produces a vatting of peated and unpeated malts under the name Peaty Tang, which bears no age indication. In the US, this offering is labeled \"Tomintoul, the gentile dram with a peaty tang &#8211; Speyside Glenlivet\", in a 40%ABV 750ml bottling. Additionally, it has released a peated single malt called Ballantruan. Lastly, it bottles a 1976 vintage.[5] The 33 year old offering was chosen as best Speyside whisky of 2010 in the Whiskymag World_Whiskies_Awards.[6] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Gabriel Savage (9 September 2009). \"Tomintoul_goes_large\".\nthedrinksbusiness.com.\n2. ^ a b c d e f g Johannes van den Heuvel. \"Tomintoul_distillery_profile\".\nmaltmadness.com.\n3. ^ a b Helen Arthur (2002) [1997].

These were converted to be heated by wood chips in 1984, a by&#8211;product of area\'s forestry. [4] Long John was absorbed by Whitbread_&amp;_Co in 1975, and the distillery was acquired by Allied_Distillers_Ltd the same year.

The distillery appears on the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, dated 1872, marked as a ruin. The reasons for its demise are unclear &#8211; very little remains of the original distillery and there are no known photographs. However, records of its annual production volumes of whisky can be found in tax returns, which show it producing 28,056\nTotal Gallons of Proof Spirit\nduring 1826[5] (roughly 125,000 litres)\nmaking it the biggest distillery in Caithness at the time. <u> Revival[edit] </u> In 2012 a private consortium gained approval from the Caithness planning authorities to build a new Wolfburn distillery in Henderson Park, Thurso.[6][7] [8] The new distillery is situated approximately 350m from the site of the old one and draws its water from the Wolf_Burn (stream) from whence it gets its name. The reinvented Wolfburn site consists of three buildings: the distillery itself and two warehouses for the laying down of casks. Local fabricators Forsyths were contracted to install the distillery plant and equipment. Wolfburn is the most northerly distillery on the Scottish mainland and produces single malt Scotch whisky.

    <string name="cameronbridge" formatted="false"><b> Cameron Bridge </b>(Redirected from Cameronbridge) Cameron Bridge is a village in the conurbation of Levenmouth in Fife, Scotland. It is near to the village of Windygates and only 2 miles west of the town of Leven. A distillery was established in the 19th century by the Haig family, which is now part of Diageo.[1] The distillery produces Scotch_whisky. <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History_and_locality\n* 2_The_Cameronbridge_Grain_Distillery\n* 3_Future_transport\n* 4_References\n* 5_External_links <u> History and locality[edit] </u> It is a settlement at a bridge over the River_Leven, which replaced a ford here. When Leven was flooded it was the first upstream crossing. In 1870, an earlier bridge was replaced with a new one.[1] Another river is located nearby, the River_Ore. <u> The Cameronbridge Grain Distillery[edit] </u> In 1824 the Haig distillery was opened. In 1826 it became the first distillery to produce Grain_whisky using the Column_still method invented by Robert Stein. In 1877 John Haig &amp; Co merged with 5 other whisky companies to form the Distillers_Company, with John Haig &amp; Co coming under DCL\'s full ownership in 1919. Cameron Bridge produced both grain and malt whisky using a combination of pot_stills and column_stills until 1929, when it shifted exclusively to grain whisky production. For a period between 1941 to 1947, the distillery closed due to World_War_II. The current Column still house was constructed during the 1960s, and two of its three stills are more than 30 years old. The third was transferred from Carsebridge distillery in Alloa when it was closed by United_Distillers in 1983. Major renovations at Cameron Bridge occurred in 1989&#8211;1992 as well as up to 2000 when the distillery produced up to 30 million imperial gallons (140,000,000 L) of spirit annually.[2][3] In 1989 Cameronbridge also changed from being solely a large&#8211;scale grain whisky distillery into a\ndual&#8211;purpose\nsite, when United_Distillers\nGrain Neutral Spirit operation was transferred to Fife from Wandsworth in London. Now GNS for white spirits and\nsweetened products\nsuch as Archers, Pimm\'s, Smirnoff, Tanqueray and Gordon\'s_Gin are also produced alongside grain spirit used in the Johnnie_Walker, J&amp;B, Bell\'s, Black_&amp;_White, Vat_69, Haig and White_Horse blended whisky brands owned by Diageo.[4] It is currently the largest of the remaining grain distilleries in Scotland [citation_needed] and is owned by Diageo. <u> Future transport[edit] </u> A railway_station could be located in Cameron Bridge in the future, which would also serve as at Park_and_Ride site. Rail freight provisions could also be provided to serve the distillery. This is as part of the Levenmouth_rail_link.

The site had a number of distinct advantages:[2]\n* A supply of water from the Pentland_Hills via the Union_Canal\n* Direct access to the developing national railway network via the\nEdinburgh_Suburban_and_Southside_Junction_Railway, allowing input access\nfor grain and output distribution of product\n* Close access to the Port_of_Leith, allowing easy import of grain and\nlater maize\n* The new main city sewer ran less than 100 yards (91 m) from the site,\nallowing easy flushout of effluent\n* The local dairy farms provided a ready made market for the disposal of\nthe draff and dreg residue from the distilling process Production started in 1887,[1] and within a year of opening the distillery was producing 3,600,000 litres (790,000 gal; 950,000 gal) of spirit per year,[2] output at a price of one shilling and three pence per proof gallon.[3] By the start of World_War_I, production had risen to 9,000,000 litres (2,000,000 gal; 2,400,000 gal) per annum,[3] but came to a halt in 1917 due to a lack of economic supply of grain.[3] Almost converted to acetone production for use in munitions, the site resumed production in 1920. Having reached pre&#8211;war production levels by 1925, with prohibition in the United States, followed by the 1930s Great_Depression, production fell to an all time low of 1,200,000 litres (260,000 gal; 320,000 gal) per annum.[3] Production had barely recovered to similar post&#8211;World War I levels by the start of World_War_II,[3] which again saw production suspended.[2] The site was used initially as a grain store, and latterly as a D_Day supplies depot.[3] Just after resumption of production, in 1948 Scotland\'s first saladin_maltings were installed.[2] With rationing ending in the early 1950s, this spurred production to pre&#8211;World War I levels again.[3] In the late 1950s the site was expanded to include the adjacent former Edinburgh_Corporation_Tramways depot, to provide space for new warehouses.[2] In 1967, the Darney quarry at East Woodburn, Northumberland was reopened to allow an extension to the buildings in the original stone, and kept open for two years to allow additional offices and brewing facilities to be added.[3] In 1970, 30 acres (12 ha) of land were purchased at Addiewell, West_Lothian to create six new racked warehouses and a filling store, added to by an additional three racked warehouses in 1975. That same year an additional 30 acres (12 adjacent plot was purchased on the opposite (south) side of the A71 road. At this time, expansion of output was enabled by substantial investment in production facilities enabling 36,400,000 litres (8,000,000 gal; 9,600,000 gal) to be produced in 1979.[3] The late 1970s/early 1980s downturn brought job losses, as production capacity had been planned on a 10% year&#8211;on&#8211;year increase.[3] After output fell to 11,400,000 litres (2,500,000 gal; 3,000,000 gal), the economic revival brought consolidation across Scotch whisky production, and resulted in the 1988 closure of the Caledonian, Edinburgh\'s other grain distillery.[3] Hence by 1991, output had recovered to 41,700,000 litres (9,200,000 gal; 11,000,000 gal).[3] In 1993, shareholders Robertson &amp; Baxter and International_Distillers_&amp; Vintners formed joint_venture company Lothian Distillers,[2] which bought out all other shareholders for an agreed price of\n84 Million.[3] After the completion of the replacement of the exploded No.4 still, an expansion plan allowed the production of a grain&#8211;neutral spirt to support IDV\'s Smirnoff_vodka brand, and maximum plant capacity to rise to 61,600,000 litres (13,600,000 gal; 16,300,000 gal).[3] In February 1998, the company produced its 1,500,000,000 l.alc of whisky since its inception in 1885. A commemorative new bourbon barrel was filled to mark the occasion, and took pride of place in No. 1 warehouse at Wheatfield Road.[3] Rationalisation led to the sale of the maltings and warehouse site on Slateford Road and the Westfield Road warehousing site in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Warehousing in Edinburgh is now restricted to the original No. 1 Warehouse at Wheatfield Road which offers traditional style storage for casks laid down for longer periods of maturation. The vast majority of maturation warehousing is at Addiewell where a further four warehouses have been built since 2002, on the site bought in 1975.[2][3] <u> Current[edit] </u> A bonded_warehouse in Addiewell for the North British Distillery Lothian Distillers, and hence the sites and production, is jointly owned by Diageo plc and the privately held Edrington_Group. Increased sales of Scotch whisky to India, China and South America brought about production of 65,000,000 litres (14,000,000 gal; 17,000,000 gal) in 2007,[3] produced for:[2]\n* Diageo subsidiary United_Distillers_&amp;_Vintners: Smirnoff vodka,\nJohnnie_Walker whisky\n* Edrington: constituent of blended whiskies, including Famous_Grouse and\nCutty_Sark whisky To enable this, the company imports maize (3,000 tonnes (3,300 tons) per week from France via the Port of Leith), along with a lesser amount of malted barley.[2] The waste output husks are pelletised into cattle&#8211;feed, while the liquefied carbon_dioxide is sold via contractor Air_Products.[2] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b \"North_British_Distillery\". scotchwhisky.net.

More recently it has also become known for the repair of oil_rigs which line up in the Cromarty Firth on which the town is situated. In the 1970s and 1980s nearby Nigg was known for the construction of these rigs. The yard used for this is now attempting to re&#8211;establish itself as a fabricator of large offshore wind turbines and oil rig refurbishment since being purchased by Global Energy Group. For a number of years Invergordon was the site of an aluminium_smelter until 1981 when British_Aluminium closed it down. The pipeline that covered the conveyor belt from the smelter to the BA pier was not dismantled until the early 2000s and the two large tanks still stand today as well as a water tower. It still has a grain whisky distillery, operated by Indian&#8211;owned whisky giant Whyte_and_Mackay, the output of which contributes to many blended whiskies. At present the port is visited by many large cruise_liners each year, as the deep water port allows disembarkation for coach tours in the northern Highlands. Since the 1970s some would perceive the town as a \'Glasgow colony\', since many workers were recruited from southern Scotland to work in the oil_rig fabrication and aluminium smelting industries. As a result, the residents\' accents often show more influence from Glasgow, than the surrounding Easter Ross dialect of Highland_English although this has changed in recent years. In recent years Global Energy Group have been expanding, with the purchase of the Nigg fabrication yard it has also brought much appreciated work to Invergordon\'s Docks with the town again full of oil company workers through the day. <u> Naval Base[edit] </u> A naval_base in the early 20th century, evidence of which remains in the tank farm lying behind the town centre, which used to contain fuel oil and water for admiralty ships, and the Admiralty Pier, where once warships docked and which is now used for cruise ships in the summer and oil field support vessels through the year. One German bomb hit one of the tanks during World_War_II when a large flying boat base occupied much of the northerly coast of the Cromarty Firth, the result of this being that the fuel oil flowed onto the railway tracks. According to town history the bomb did not explode. <u> Culture[edit] </u> Invergordon is now the mural town of the Highlands and hopes to emulate the success of her mentor in Chemainus,_British_Columbia. Currently the town is adorned with a series of 17 murals. The paintwork created by a selection of artists tells the stories of the local community and the area. This trail is a result of a community project which was initially designed to integrate local community groups (17 in total took part). The trail, which was opened by the Princess Royal, now acts as a major tourist draw. Now Invergordon_Off_The_Wall, the group who facilitated the project, have just completed their latest project creating three new pieces with the assistance of inspirational artists DUFI( Al Macinnes &amp; Fin Macrae), The Mobile Foundry (Kevin Blackwell &amp; Roddy Mathieson)and not forgetting Del Whitticase. Take a moment to view their pieces, Channel, Foundations and Bubblefield. As ever, these artists drew their source material from working with a broad cross&#8211;section of local people. <u> Infrastructure[edit] </u> Panorama of Invergordon The town is served by Invergordon_railway_station which lies on the far north line, connecting Wick with Inverness and is in close proximity to the A9 trunk road. As of 2012, there is a controversial scheme for a waste incinerator at the Cromarty Firth Industrial Park in Invergordon for which the Scottish government are now reviewing following protests by the local community. The\n43 million plant would be built by Combined Power and Heat (Highlands) Ltd.[1] <u> Education[edit] </u> Invergordon has one secondary school, Invergordon Academy, which is fed by four primary schools, Newmore Primary School, Park Primary School, South Lodge Primary School and Milton Primary School. In 2013 the Highland Council announced plans for a new super school to serve Ross shire with the preferred option being that it be built in Invergordon. This has seen much protest by locals and is currently under review. If it went ahead Alness and Tain academies would close and there would also be a change to the local primary schools. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Scotsman_article_by_Frank_Urquart,_1_December_2012 </string>

This distillery had better access to rail transport (via the Great_North_of_Scotland_Railway) and a better water source in the springs on Fiskaidly farm. Although the Banff distillery had dealt with fires and explosions in the past, a particularly bad fire damaged or destroyed much of the distillery apart from the warehouse on 9 May 1877. By October of the same year, Simpson had rebuilt the distillery and restored operation. He also then kept a fire_engine on the premises. In 1921, Simpson\'s family sold a portion of the distillery to the London&#8211;based Mile End Distillery Company. In 1932, a subsidiary of Distillers Company Ltd. bought the entire distillery for\n50,000, and stopped production immediately. On 16 August 1941, a Nazi Junkers_Ju_88 attacked the Banff distillery and destroyed warehouse No. 12.[3] Many whisky casks burned and a great deal of stock was lost. Farmers reported that the whisky had run into nearby water supplies and intoxicated the local animal population.[2] Repair on the distillery started in the winter of 1941. In 1943, No._248_Squadron_RAF was moved to the site of the distillery and remained there until the end of the war. After World_War_II ended, renovation on the Banff distillery began with the intent of restoring it to operation. While one of the stills was being repaired by a coppersmith on 3 October 1959, vapors inside were ignited and caused an explosion that destroyed the still and damaged part of the distillery.[2] The distillery\'s parent company was fined\n15 for having violated safety regulations. When renovation was finally complete, the distillery returned to operating status and continued to produce whisky until it was finally mothballed in 1983. By the late 1980s, most of the distillery\'s buildings had been dismantled or demolished. The last warehouse was destroyed in a fire[2] on 11 April 1991. <u> Operation[edit] </u> The stills at Banff were fed by hand with coal until 1963, when a system was put in place to deliver the coal mechanically. In 1970, the stills were converted to be heated by oil burners. Cooling water was drawn from Burn of Boydine. Banff used a triple&#8211;distillation process until 1924. </string>

It was founded by D. G. Ross, but was then sold to Scotch Whisky Distillers in 1887. When Scotch Whisky Distillers was liquidated, the Ben Wyvis distillery was sold to the Ferintosh Distillery Co. Ltd., which was owned by Kirker, Greer &amp; Co. in Belfast. The name was then changed to \"Ferintosh\". As of 2010, no whisky from this distillery is known to exist. A residential development on the original site is \"Wyvis House\". The Ben Wyvis distillery that began operation in 1965 was started by the Invergordon distillery, and was built on the Invergordon grain distillery complex. It was intended primarily to produce whisky for use in Invergordon blends, but did produce a very small number of single malts. When Ben Wyvis was dismantled in 1977, the stills were saved and eventually used by the Glengyle distillery. <u> Single malts[edit] </u> Legitimate single malt bottlings from the distillery\'s 1965&#8211;1977 operation are exceptionally rare. Years after the distillery had closed, Invergordon offered a single malt under the \"Ben Wyvis\" name, but for a retail price approximately 20. This led to at least one incident where a such a bottle was placed in an auction with estimates meant to imply that it was an original Ben Wyvis single malt: on March 28, 2007, McTear\'s_Auctioneers offered Lot 166 (a 10&#8211;year&#8211;old Ben Wyvis) with an estimated value of\n400&#8211; 600, and the auction closed with a sale price of\n360. After significant public&#8211;relations pressure developed over the possible misrepresentation of the whisky, McTear\'s offered to cancel the sale. </string>

Dallas Dhu means \"Black Water Valley\" in Gaelic. Its whisky also appeared as a \"Dallas Mhor\" single malt.[2] In 1899, Alexander Edward designed the Dallas Dhu distillery at the height of the whisky boom. Later he sold the plans and the distillery was built by the blender Wright and Greg. It was acquired by Benmore Distilleries Ltd, which joined DCL in 1929. The stillhouse was destroyed by a fire in 1939, but rebuilt. Production continued until the distillery closed in 1983; it is now a museum. <u> History[edit] </u> Originally named \"Dallasmore\", the Dallas Dhu distillery was built in 1898 by Alexander Edward of the Sanquhar estate outside Forres. It featured a pagoda roof designed by Scottish architect Charles_C._Doig. When ownership of the distillery changed to Wright &amp; Greig Ltd. in 1899, it was renamed to \"Dallas Dhu\". Production began on May 29, 1899, and the first cask was filled on June 3.[4] Starting in 1909, David_Lloyd_George introduced restrictions on distilling in the United_Kingdom; these included increased taxes and the requirement that all whisky sold had been aged for at least three years.[4] In 1919, the distillery was sold to J. P. O\'Brian &amp; Co., and then again to Benmore Distilleries Ltd. in 1921 (around which time, the Dallas Dhu malt whisky was used in the Benmore blended whisky.) The Benmore owners installed new equipment, including electric lighting and mechanized switchers for the wash backs. After Benmore\'s acquisition by Distillers_Company (DCL) in 1928, the distillery was closed until 1936. It was also transferred to the DCL subsidiary, Scottish Malt Distillers (SMD). On April 9, 1939, the distillery (along with much of its equipment) was damaged by a fire. The distillery manager\'s wife called for the Forres Fire Brigade, who arrived quickly and brought the fire under control in four hours. Damage was estimated at\n7000. The fire and the start of World_War_II delayed the distillery\'s re&#8211;opening until March 30, 1947.[4] Most equipment was powered by steam engines and a large water_wheel until the 1950s, when it was replaced with electric power. The worm tubs were replaced in 1956, and increasing demand saw the installation of two more wash backs, one new mash tun and one boiler in 1964. An elevator was installed in the malt barn in 1966. Between 1968 and 1969, the stills were replaced, and they were converted from coal heat to oil&#8211;fired steam heat in 1971.[4] SMD had built a malting plant in Burghead, intended to provide malt for a number of SMD\'s distilleries; this led to Dallas Dhu stopping use of its own malting floor, which was last used on March 30, 1968. Economic pressure and an unreliable water supply forced Dallas Dhu to close in 1983, and its distilling license was withdrawn in 1992. The last barrel was filled on March 16, 1983, although the buildings were re&#8211;opened to the public in 1988 under Scotland\'s Historic Buildings and Monument Directorate. Historic Scotland has operated the property since its establishment in 1992. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Dallas_Dhu_on_Whisky.com\n2. ^ Jackson, Michael (2004).

In 1884, Simon Forbes purchased the distillery and enjoyed some success with it. He operated it until 1915. The distillery was silent for most of World_War_I, but opened for a short time in 1923&#8211;1924 as the Glenugie Distillery Ltd, but again remained silent from 1925 to 1937. Seager Evans &amp; Co Ltd then re&#8211;opened it in 1937. Scheney International acquired Seager Evans &amp; Co Ltd in 1956 and decided to improve the equipment and used an oil system to replace the coal fired boiler, as well as introducing a pair of new stills with condensers. This led to production doubling. The solution on the resultant strain on the workshop was to cease site malting and also to convert the malt house to warehouse space. <u> Closure[edit] </u> Glenugie was one of a number of distilleries that failed to continue past the 1983 market.[2] This was because there was too much competition at the time, leading to about a dozen single malt distilleries closing in this year. The distillery was dismantled and the premises were taken over by Score_Group plc, who have built their workshops on this site. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Halley, Ned (2005).

Weeks after opening, a fire destroyed stocks of barley, along with the kiln and parts of the malting floor. Two weeks after the fire, worker James Clark died in an accident with the boiler. Robert Barclay died in 1854, and the distillery was auctioned to William Richie three years later.[1] The maltings of Glenury Royal were closed in 1968. The distillery then kept producing malt whisky for almost two more decades, but eventually it was mothballed on May 31, 1985.

The buildings of the distillery were sold in 1993 to a property company who turned part of these buildings into apartments.

A limited release of a 36yo bottling (ABV 51.2%) was released in 2005, and the size of this batch was 2100 bottles. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ \"Glenury_Royal_&#8211;_Scotch_malt_whisky_distillery_profile\".\nMaltMadness.com.

Situated on the border of Lowlands and Highlands, its products were generally classified as lowlands whisky.[1] The year when whisky was first produced is uncertain. Littlemill was described as part of the purchase of Auchentorlie Estate in the 1750s. In 1772 houses had been constructed for excise officers, which is also the year Littlemill claimed as its foundation year, from which it claimed to be the oldest distillery in Scotland.[2][3] The distillery changed ownership to Matthew Clark &amp; Co in 1817.[3] After the Customs_and_Excise_Act_1823 had passed, which allowed the distilling of whisky at much lower licence costs, Jane Macgregor became the licencee of Littlemill.[2] Around 1840 ownership went to Hector Henderson, who was also shareholder in the Campbelltown distillery in 1837 and founded the Caol_Ila distillery. The distillery was rebuilt and expanded in 1875 by Hay, who then was the owner.[2][3] Littlemill closed in 1929 until it was bought and reopened by Duncan Thomas in 1931,[3] who experimented at the distillery with different new techniques. He used a new design of a Saladin_box for malting with two ventilation towers and a single kiln. The copper pot_stills were aluminium coated, and used rectifying columns instead of swan necks to have greater control over the distillation process, and production switched from a triple distillation to a double distillation technique.[2] In 1971 the distillery changed hands to Barton_Distilling, who had been a shareholder since 1959. Barton was bought by Amalgamated Distilled Products in 1982, which joined the Argyll_Group in 1984. In this year the Littlemill distillery closed.[3][4] It was reopened and bought by Gibson_International in 1989, closed down again in 1994 after Gibson International went bankrupt, and was sold to Loch_Lomond_Distillery. It was dismantled in 1997, and the remnants of the distillery were destroyed in a fire in 2004. A housing development is now on the site.[1][4] The distillery produced three different kinds of whisky[when?], which was made possible through the rectifying columns on the stills: a heavily peated variety under the name \"Dumbuck\", a full bodied whisky named \"Dunglas\" and a light traditional lowland whisky under its own name \"Littlemill\". Dumbuck and Dunglas were discontinued in 1972.[2][3] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b \"Littlemill\". maltmadness.com.\n2. ^ a b c d e Brown, Gordon M. (2000).

The brewery was closed by Scottish &amp; Newcastle before being quickly purchased in 1957 by Macnab Distilleries Ltd of which Joseph W. Hobbs, the proprietor of the Ben Nevis Distillery in Fort_William, was a shareholder.[2] The brewery was converted to a distillery and followed the Ben Nevis Distillery in producing both malt and grain whisky. The blended_whisky brand Sandy Macnab, was created around this time.[3] Macnab Distilleries Ltd was purchased by Spanish whisky manufacturer Destiler as_y_Crianza_del_Whisky_S.A. (popularly known as DYC) in 1973.[3] They were in turn purchased by British drinks company Allied Distillers to form Allied Domecq, who were purchased by Pernod_Ricard in 2005.[2] The distillery was closed during 1992 and the site earmarked for redevelopment. The distillery was finally demolished during 2004&#8211;2005 and the site has been turned into housing.[1][2][4] The Sandy Macnab brand name and the Macnab Distilleries Ltd company name are now owned by Pernod_Ricard through their Chivas_Regal subsidiary, following several takeovers.[2][5] <u> Production[edit] </u> Lochside was latterly fitted with a cast iron mash tun and open stainless steel washbacks. Distillation was carried out using 2 wash stills and 2 spirit stills. The distillery was also fitted with grain stills, which, under DYC\'s tenure, were unused. Spirit was matured in ex&#8211;bourbon casks.[1][2] The majority of the spirit produced at this time was shipped to Spain for use in DYC Spanish whisky, and the remainder used for the firm\'s Sandy Macnab brand of blended whisky or for bottling as a single_malt aged 10 Years.[2][3] Sandy Macnab was generally an export only brand and was widely available in Southern European markets.[3] Limited stocks of Lochside Single Malt remain available.[6] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c Milroy, Wallace (1998).

Its whisky was an important component of the \"Mill Burn\" vatted malt. <u> History[edit] </u> The distillery was founded as \"Inverness Distillery\" by one Mr. Welsh in 1807 (sixteen years before the passage of the Excise Act of 1823, which legalized whisky distillation.) It came under the control of James Rose and Alexander MacDonald in 1825, but the company was sold off four years later. In 1853, David Rose acquired the distillery and transferred control to his son, George Rose, in 1881. The younger Rose ran the distillery until 1892, when it was sold again to Andrew Haig &amp; Co. In 1904, the distillery\'s name was officially changed to \"Millburn\" with the formation of the Millburn Distillery Company. In 1921, Millburn was acquired by Booth\'s_Distillers_Ltd. of London. The owners were able to rebuild and restore operation after a fire damaged the distillery in 1922. Millburn became part of the Distillers Company Ltd. family as a result of the 1935 merger of Booth\'s with William Sanderson &amp; Co., which itself was purchased by DCL in 1937. DCL moved Millburn under the control of Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd in 1943. Millburn was closed in 1985, and in 1988 many of the buildings were demolished to allow for the property to be re&#8211;developed. In 1989, a restaurant named \"The Auld Distillery\" was opened in one of the remaining Millburn buildings. Coordinates: 57 56.7 20.8 57.482417 4.205778 _/_57.482417;_&#8211;4.205778 </string>

Holt &amp; Company Limited purchased the distillery and its extensive stock in 1922 and around 1928, transferred it to DCL subsidiary Scottish Malt Distillers.[1][3] Production at the distillery ceased for a period from about 1926 28 and lasting until 1937 when it resumed only to be halted again at the onset of World_War_II due to the fuel and barley rationing instituted by the government. Production resumed in 1948 and continued until the distillery closed permanently in 1983.[1] The owners sold the site for re&#8211;development in 1990 and shortly afterwards, Safeway constructed a supermarket the site.[3] Somerfield purchased the store in October 2004 as part of a larger sale.[4] Bottlings of North Port Distillery Single Malt are still available.[3] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c d e Morrice, Philip (22 September 1983).

Its name originated after the roses which grew along the side of the canal.[1] <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\n* 2_Taste_and_Reviews\n* 3_Footnotes\n* 4_Bibliography\n* 5_References <u> History[edit] </u> Records exists, showing that a distillery existed in Falkirk as early as 1798, it was run by the Stark brothers in Laurieston.[2] In 1817, James Robertson opened a distillery nearby named Rosebank &#8211; records are unclear as to whether this was in the same location as the later distillery. It remained open only until 1819.[3] In 1827 John Stark (of the brothers) opened Camelon distillery on the west bank of the canal, he ran this until his death in 1836. After this time the Camelon distillery was run by Thomas Gunn and his father. In 1840 the Gunn\'s were approached by James Rankine to either buy or lease the Camelon distillery Maltings (on the east bank of the canal) where he set up a new distillery under the Rosebank name.[3] The new Rosebank quickly grew, requiring expansion in 1845 and rebuilding in 1864. Indeed in 1861 when Camelon Distillery went bankrupt, Rankine was able to purchase it as well and demolish it, leaving only the maltings for the use of Rosebank.[3] Rosebank Distillery Ltd was formed in 1894, and in 1914 it was among the companies that amalgamated to form the Scottish Malt Distillers. Later the group became part of DCL.[4] In 1886, the distillery was visited by Alfred_Barnard, who noted that it was set across two sites one on each side of the canal with a swing bridge linking the pair. The malt was produced in the former Camelon maltings on the west side of the canal, then would be transferred over to the distillery on the east side by means of the swing bridge. He also noted that their warehouse at the time had storage for 500,000 gallons (1,892,705.9 litres)[4] Rosebank was once considered one of the premier lowland whiskies but United Distillers mothballed the distillery in 1993.[5] The reason given for the mothballing was that its effluent treatment would have required a\n2m upgrade in order to comply with European standards of the time, this did not make it commercially viable. At the time of its closure, it still retained many historical features in the production of the whisky.[1] By 1988, the bonded warehouse for the distillery (on the west bank of the canal) had been sold off and redeveloped, partially becoming a Beefeater Pub and Grill.[6] In 2002, the distillery buildings and contents were sold to British_Waterways by Diageo, and the maltings were demolished to make way for a housing development.[2][7] In 2008 plans were started to open a new distillery in Falkirk original Rosebank equipment.[8] However over Christmas and New Year 2008/2009, the original Rosebank Stills (along with other equipment) were stolen by metal_thieves and were not recovered.[2] Plans for the new distillery have continued to develop gaining Scottish Government approval, the new building being near the Laurieston site of the original Rosebank distillery. Despite suggestion that the new whisky may be produced under the Rosebank name, Diageo &#8211; who own the Rosebank trademark and continue to release limited bottles of original Rosebank whisky &#8211; have denied this.[9] <u> Taste and Reviews[edit] </u> Rosebank is similar to other lowland single malts in having a taste associated with fruits, grasses, and particularly flowers,[10] Being casked in oak lends to oak flavourings within the malt as well &#8211; the distillery described the nose as \"light and distinctive\" and the flavour \"well balanced\".[1] The late writer Michael_Jackson, described the whisky as\nThe finest example of a Lowland malt\nand considered the closure of the distillery\na grievous loss.\n[11] In his \"Complete book of Whisky\", Jim_Murray notes that a previous writer[fn_1] could not be taken seriously after making the claim that \"none of them [Lowland malts] approaches the sunny majesty of the Highland malts...\" &#8211; Murray maintains that Rosebank is the \"superior Lowlander\" and should be ranked in the top five of all Scottish malts.[1] <u> Footnotes[edit] </u>\n1. ^ Brian Murphy in his World Book of Whisky(1978) <u> Bibliography[edit] </u>\n* Townsend, Brian (2000).

During its early life, it was known as \"Linlithgow\" after the town in which it was built, and was originally located at Bonnytoun.[1] It moved to the St. Magdalene site in 1834, to be close to the Union_Canal.[1] Before the distillery existed, the site was home to a leper colony, convent, and hospital at various points in time between the 12th century and the distillery\'s 18th&#8211; century founding. The distillery took its name from St Magdalene\'s Hospital, a lazar_house which once stood upon the site.[2][3] For the majority of the 19th century the distillery was run by the Dawson family, initially by Adam Dawson (1747 1836), who had trained as a maltster and was the youngest son of a sheep farmer from Kippendavie near Dunblane. Adam Dawson and his wife Frances McKell had ten children, including James_Dawson the prominent champion of Aboriginal interests. Another son, John Dawson (1796 1878), continued the distillery business along with his brother Adam Dawson_Jnr (1793 1873). By 1856 the distillery was capable of producing 4,000 US gallons (15,000 l; 3,300 gal) of whisky per week, and employed around 30 people.[2] The sale of the distillery to Distillers_Company in 1912,[4] was brought about by the untimely death in January 1912 of John Kellie Dawson, son of Adam Dawson Jnr, from meningitis at the age of 43. St. Magdalene was renovated in 1927. After St. Magdalene closed in 1983, some of the buildings were converted into apartments. They retained their distinctive pagoda roofs, and are protected as category C listed_buildings.[1][5] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b c \"St_Magdalene\'s_Distillery_East_Barns:_Listed_building_report\".\nHistoric Scotland.\n2. ^ a b \"St_Magdalene\'s_Distillery,_Malting_Barn_And_Double_Kiln\".

It is located to the south of Tullibody, to the northwest of Alloa, and about 4 miles east of Stirling, across the river.[1] It lies on the River_Devon, near its confluence with the River_Forth.[1] <u> Distillery[edit] </u> A whisky distillery was founded in Cambus in 1806.[2]It or another was re&#8211; established by John Mowbray in 1813[3] or perhaps 1836.[4] In 1877 ownership was merged into the Distillers_Company. The distillery was closed down in 1993. [4][2] The Cambus_Iron_Bridge over the Devon was constructed in the early 19th century to span the River Devon and link with the distillery founded in 1806. It is a Category_A_listed_building and a Scheduled_Ancient_Monument.[5] <u> Rail connections[edit] </u> From the early 1850s until 1968 Cambus was served by passenger trains of the Stirling_and_Dunfermline_Railway. The station was to the west of the level crossing on the road into the village, and had a large signal box, which controlled two level crossings, the junction with the line to Menstrie and Alva, and access to sidings in the brewery and distillery. The line was re&#8211; opened in 2008 as part of the Stirling&#8211;Alloa&#8211;Kincardine_rail_link. The new railway has a passing_loop to the east of the road into Cambus village, but no station at this point in time. <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b Hughes, William (1863).

The town lies on the north bank of the River_Clyde where the River_Leven flows into the Clyde estuary. As of 2006, the town had an estimated population of 19,990 and forms a conurbation with Alexandria, Bonhill and Renton with a combined estimated population of 44,690.[5] Dumbarton functioned as the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Alclud, and later as the county_town of the county of Dunbartonshire. Dumbarton_Castle, sitting on top of Dumbarton Rock, dominates the area. Dumbarton was a Royal_burgh between 1222 and 1975.[7] Dumbarton emerged from the 19th century as a centre for shipbuilding, glassmaking, and whisky production. However these industries have since declined, or demised altogether, and Dumbarton today increasingly functions as a commuter_town for the major City_of_Glasgow which is 13 miles (21 km) east&#8211; southeast. Dumbarton_F.C. is the burgh\'s local association football club.

It was the site of a strategically important Roman settlement known as Alcluith of a province named Valentia.[8] The next record of a settlement in Dumbarton is a record in Irish chronicles of the death of Guret, rex Alo Cluathe (\"king of Clyde Rock\"), in AD 658.[9] The Old Dumbarton Bridge over the River_Leven was built in 1765 by John Brown of Dumbarton, at the site of a ferry crossing. It was constructed at the behest of the Duke_of_Argyll, who was anxious to obtain access to Glasgow from his estate at Rosneath. The bridge, with five segmental arches with rounded cutwaters, resulted in the extension of Dumbarton to West Bridgend. It is now B&#8211;listed and was refurbished in 2006. The fortress of Dumbarton was the stronghold of the kingdom of Alclud, and the centre of British power in northern Britain, for more than two centuries from the mid&#8211;seventh century, until the Vikings destroyed the fortress after a four month siege in 870. The loss of the British power base led to the emergence of the new kingdom_of_Strathclyde, or Cumbria, with a major centre at Govan. The title \"king of the Britons of Srath Cl ade\" was first used in 872.[10] Dumbarton was later the county town of the county of Dunbartonshire, formerly known as Dumbartonshire. The name comes from the Scottish_Gaelic D n Breatainn meaning \"fort of the Brythons (Britons)\", and serves as a reminder that the earliest historical inhabitants of Clydesdale spoke an early form of the Welsh language. In September 1605 Chancellor Dunfermline reported to King James VI that inundations of the sea were likely to destroy and take away the whole town. It was estimated that the flood defences would cost 30,000 pounds Scots, the cost being levied nationwide.[11] During World_War_II Dumbarton was heavily bombed by the German_air_force. The Germans were targeting the shipyards, and the area in the vicinity of the yards was consequently hit, with Clyde and Leven Street being severely damaged. In an attempt to lure the German aircraft away from the shipyards, decoy lights were routinely placed on the Kilpatrick hills above the town, lights were set out on reservoirs to mimic those of the shipyards reflecting on the waters of the Leven and Clyde. The ploy was sometimes successful in diverting the bombers and many bombs fell harmlessly onto the moors and lochs. <i> Castle[edit] </i> Main article: Dumbarton_Castle Looking across the River_Clyde towards Dumbarton_Castle Dumbarton Rock from the west Dumbarton_Castle sits on Dumbarton_Rock, at the east bank mouth of the River Leven, where it flows into the Clyde estuary. The Castle has an illustrious history and many well&#8211;known figures from Scottish and British history have visited it. The castle was a royal fortress long before Dumbarton became a Royal_Burgh, its ownership went from Scottish to English and back again. The castle was an important place during the Wars_of Independence and was used to imprison William_Wallace for a short time after his capture by the English. It was from here that Mary,_Queen_of_Scots, was conveyed to France for safety as a child. Mary was trying to reach Dumbarton Castle when she suffered her final defeat at Langside. In later times, Queen Victoria and Queen_Elizabeth_II visited the castle. Today, Dumbarton Rock is a Scheduled_Ancient_Monument, it has legal protection in order to maintain and conserve the site for the future. As such any sort of work on the rock is strictly regulated by the Scottish_Government and activities such as climbing on the rock are forbidden. From the top of the castle can be seen both the River_Clyde and Leven Grove Park. <i> Levengrove Park[edit] </i> Levengrove Park itself was a gift to the town by the Denny and McMillan families who owned shipbuilding companies with yards located adjacent to the Castle. This was said to be not a purely philanthropic act however; the American company Singer which is famous for the manufacturing of sewing machines had earmarked the land as a potential site for their factory which would eventually be built in nearby Clydebank. Denny were in effect protecting their monopoly on the local work&#8211;force. A grave site in the park sits as the resting place for the viscera of former Scottish king Robert_the_Bruce. Removal of this \"viscera\" for local burial was commonplace at the time, when a persons remains were to be transported a long distance for their own burial.[12] <u> Geography and governance[edit] </u> Dumbarton\'s Civic Coat of Arms A northwards view of Dumbarton across the tidal River_Clyde, with the distant Ben_Lomond visible to the right of Dumbarton Rock From 1975 Dumbarton lent its name to a local_government district in the Strathclyde region of Scotland. In 1996 the administrative functions of this district transferred to the West_Dunbartonshire and Argyll_and_Bute unitary councils (see Subdivisions_of_Scotland). Dumbarton town currently serves as the administrative centre of the West Dunbartonshire authority. There is a Dumbarton_constituency_of_the_Scottish_Parliament and a former Dumbarton_constituency_of_the_House_of_Commons. <i> Districts[edit] </i> There are a number of distinct areas within the town:\n* Bellsmyre\n* Brucehill\n* Castlehill\n* Dennystown\n* Dumbarton_East_incl._Newtown\n* Oxhill\n* Kirktonhill\n* Silverton\n* Townend\n* Westcliff <u> Education[edit] </u> Two secondary schools are located in Dumbarton, namely Dumbarton_Academy and Our_Lady_&amp;_St_Patrick\'s_High_School. The town is also served by seven primary schools; St. Michael\'s Primary, Knoxland Primary, Braehead Primary, St. Peter\'s Primary, St. Patrick\'s Primary, Aitkenbar Primary and Dalreoch Primary. <u> Economy and transport[edit] </u> <i> Shipbuilding[edit] </i> From the mid 18th century to the early 19th century Dumbarton\'s main industry was glassmaking. As the glass industry declined the town became a major centre for shipbuilding and remained so well into the 20th century. There were many shipbuilding yards, although a number of them were later absorbed by larger yards. A great many ships were built in the town, the most famous of which is probably the Cutty_Sark which was built by Scott_&amp;_Linton, she was one of the final Tea_Clippers to be built, and one of the fastest. The ship is the last survivor of its type and can be seen today at dry_dock in Greenwich, London. <i> William Denny and Brothers[edit] </i>\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(January 2014) Early side&#8211;lever engine designed by Robert_Napier, from PS Leven (1823), on display at the Scottish_Maritime_Museum The last major Dumbarton shipyard was William_Denny_and_Brothers which closed in 1963, and the remaining smaller yards followed over the next few decades. The old Denny\'s shipyard tender The_Second_Snark is still in use on the Firth of_Clyde as a passenger_ferry and cruise boat. Denny\'s was an innovative company that had a reputation for research and development; high pressure turbines and hull stabilisation were two areas where they were highly respected. They even built an early design of helicopter in 1909 and in their final years they were involved in hovercraft development in the form of the Denny D2 Hoverbus. A film clip of this vessel on its maiden trip to Oban exists in the Scottish_Film_Archive. The last surviving part of the Denny\'s shipbuilding company is the Denny_Ship Model_Experiment_Tank which forms part of the Scottish_Maritime_Museum. This was the first commercial ship model testing tank built in the world and it retains many original features today: a water tank as long as a football pitch, clay moulding beds for casting wax model ship hulls and the original Victorian machinery used for shaping models. During the Second World War Blackburn_Aircraft were to produce Sunderland flying boats from a factory adjacent to Denny\'s shipyard. There is still a shipyard on the river Leven, Sandpoint Marina.[13] The \'Denny Club\' was a local social club was named after Denny\'s shipyard. The club closed down a number of years ago after running into financial difficulties. The club was the sponsor of a local amateur football team, Dumbarton Amateurs, which subsequently changed its name to Denny Amateurs due to the continuning sponsorhip and support from the club. Denny Amateurs still play today, and has recently developed a team for younger players in the area, \'Denny Youth\', and has provided the new team with strips and equipment along with advice and support. <i> Whisky[edit] </i> The skyline of Dumbarton used to be dominated by the red&#8211;brick former Ballantine\'s grain distillery. Dumbarton town centre, 2006. Whisky production also grew to become a major industry in the town. In 1936 Canadian distilling company Hiram_Walker bought over the Glasgow&#8211;based distiller George_Ballantine_&amp;_Son_Ltd. In 1938 they built a large whisky distillery on the river Leven (on the site of the Archibald McMillan shipyard). As a result, the town became known as a major centre of the whisky industry in the mid to late 20th century. Hiram Walker itself was acquired by Allied Breweries in 1988 to form Allied Distillers, itself becoming part of Allied Domecq before eventually being taken over in 2005 by the French based alcohol giant Pernod_Ricard. The large Dumbarton distillery had been mothballed since 2002 and not long after the Pernod&#8211;Ricard takeover the giant red&#8211;brick buildings of the Dumbarton \'Ballantine\'s\' distillery which had dominated the town for over sixty years were earmarked for demolition and redevelopment (as of July 2008 only the tower remains standing). However the large bonded warehouse complex to the east of the town and the bottling complex to the north west were retained. Other whisky related site closures such as the Inverleven distillery which closed in 1991 and the J&amp;B Scotch Whisky bottling plant and bond in the north of the town have contributed to the decline in Dumbarton\'s importance to the drink industry. However part of the J&amp;B bond has found a new life as a film set for television productions such as \'River_City\' and \'Still_Game\'. Ballantine\'s Whisky became well known for the rather unusual \'security\' guards used at their bonded warehouse complex at Dumbuck in Dumbarton; these are a large flock of white Chinese geese that were first introduced in 1959.[14] Starting with just six individuals, this has risen to close to 100 birds today. [14] They have the nickname \'The Scotch_watch\' and have been widely used in promotional material for the Ballantine\'s blended_whisky.[14] The geese are part of the tradition of the facility, and are both a tourist attraction and advertising icon.[14] The Goosekeeper at the time (as of 1996) was Arthur Carroll,[14] But as of 1997 they have been replaced by CCTV cameras.[14] <i> Other industries[edit] </i> With the decline of the whisky industry, Dumbarton is becoming more a commuter town for those who work in nearby Glasgow and other locations. The Faslane naval_base is a major employer for the area. The Strathleven Industrial Estate near Dumbarton was once the location of several major manufacturers such as Burroughs (Adding Machines) and Westclox. Technology overtook these companies and they closed down with the loss of many jobs. The estate has also been the home of Polaroid UK since 1965. This was the largest Polaroid plant outside the USA and at its peak it employed about 1800 people. Failing to recognise the impact of digital photography was its downfall and while they still have a presence in Dumbarton, less than 100 people are now employed there (mainly in the manufacture of sunglass lenses). The generator supplier Aggreko_plc has had a facility in the town since the 1970s, in 2012 it opened a new, larger facility at the former J&amp;B plant. <i> Transport[edit] </i> Dumbarton is situated on the main A82_road, linking Glasgow to the western Scottish_Highlands. Dumbarton is a short distance from Balloch pier, where cruises can be taken on Loch_Lomond. Dumbarton is also served by three railway stations: Dumbarton_Central, Dumbarton_East and Dalreoch_railway_station. All three stations are situated on the North_Clyde_Line, which provides a direct link from Helensburgh in the west, through Glasgow_Queen_Street, to Edinburgh Waverley in the east. <u> Culture[edit] </u> <i> Sports[edit] </i> Bet_Butler_Stadium in the shadow of Dumbarton_Rock, home of Dumbarton_F.C. There were at one stage two league football clubs from the town, Dumbarton_Harp F.C. and Dumbarton_F.C. (Also known as \'Sons of the Rock\'). Dumbarton_F.C. are the only league club in Dumbarton still in operation, playing in the Scottish Professional_Football_League at Scottish_Championship level. Dumbarton_F.C. play home games at the Bet_Butler_Stadium, adjacent to Dumbarton Rock. They won the Scottish Cup in 1882/3 and are five times runners&#8211;up. The Scottish_League was formed in 1890 with Dumbarton as founding members. The first championship was shared between Dumbarton and Rangers, in the absence of a goal&#8211;difference rule to act as a tiebreaker. There are seven bowling clubs in Dumbarton: Brock_Bowling_Club, Dixon BC, Dumbarton BC, Dumbuck BC, Eastfield BC, Rock BC and Townend BC. Dumbarton is home to the basketball team Dumbarton_Dodgers_Basketball_Club who play in the Strathclyde_basketball_league. The team formed in 1981 from a youth club in Riverside Parish Church in the town. The town is the birthplace of the motor&#8211;racing driver Sir_Jackie_Stewart OBE. He competed in Formula_One between 1965 and 1973, winning three World Drivers\' Championships. The Stewart Family owned and ran the garage at Dumbuck in Milton to the East of the town, the Garage later being taken over by Jackie\'s close friend John Lindsay.[15] <i> Arts[edit] </i> The Royal Scottish Pipe Bands Championships, Dumbarton Overtoun House is now an A&#8211;listed building. Scottish poet Robert_Burns was made freeman of Dumbarton. He refers to Dumbarton in a letter written in 7 July 1787.\n\"... I have lately been rambling over by Dumbarton and Inverary, and\nrunning a drunken race on the side of Loch Lomond with a wild\nHighlandman; his horse, which had never known the ornaments of iron or\nleather, zigzagged across before my old spavin d hunter, whose name is\nJenny_Geddes, and down came the Highlandman, horse and all, and down came\nJenny and my bardship; so I have got such a skinful of bruises and\nwounds, that I shall be at least four weeks before I dare venture on my\njourney to Edinburgh.\" Dumbarton is also immortalised in the traditional Scottish song \"Dumbarton\'s Drums\".[16]\nAcross the fields of bounding heather,\nDumbarton sounds the hour of pleasure;\nThe joy I know will know no measure,\nWhen Johnnie kneels and kisses me. (one verse) Novelist A._J._Cronin\'s maternal grandfather, Archibald Montgomerie, owned a hat shop at 145 High Street. Dumbarton is the birthplace of David_Byrne, a Grammy_Award, Academy_Award and Golden_Globe&#8211;winning musician best known as the founding member and principal songwriter of new_wave band Talking_Heads. Glaswegian band Franz_Ferdinand released a remix of their hit song, \"Take_Me Out\" called \"David Byrne Was Born in Dumbarton\" which heavily sampled the Talking Heads song, \"Burning_Down_the_House\". <i> Royal Scottish Pipe Band Championships[edit] </i> Held in Dumbarton since 2000, the Royal Scottish Pipe_Band Championships sees over 140 bands enter yearly, including representatives from Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands and Ireland. The championships is one of the biggest and most prestigious pipe band events in the world. Besides the pipe band championships there is a funfair and Highland_dancing competitions. <i> Theatre[edit] </i> The Denny Civic Theatre is used by a number of local groups, including the Dumbarton_People\'s_Theatre. <i> Overtoun House[edit] </i> Overtoun House is a mansion in the Scots Baronial style built on an estate in the hills overlooking the town between 1859&#8211;1862 for a wealthy chemical manufacturer originally from Glasgow, James White.[17] The house is reputed to be haunted. In 2005 the Overtoun estate gained some notoriety as it was uncovered by a local journalist that around fifty dogs had mysteriously jumped from the Overtoun_Bridge over Overtoun burn over the years, the topic caught the public imagination and became the subject of a channel five documentary in late 2006.[18] <u> Notable people[edit] </u>\n* David_Byrne &#8211; Musician (Talking_Heads)\n* Dayton_Callie &#8211; Actor (Sons_of_Anarchy, Deadwood)\n* Zander_Diamond &#8211; Football player (Aberdeen_F.C., Oldham_Athletic, Burton\nAlbion_F.C.)\n* Scott_Duncan &#8211; Football player/manager\n* Mountstuart_Elphinstone &#8211; Historian and civil servant.\n* Jimmy_McCulloch &#8211; Musician (Paul_McCartney_and_Wings, Thunderclap_Newman,\nStone_The_Crows)\n* Jackie_Stewart &#8211; Formula 1 racing driver <u> See also[edit] </u>\n* List_of_places_in_West_Dunbartonshire\n* Mountstuart_Elphinstone, historian and civil servant from Dumbarton\n* Scotch_watch (geese) <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ \"Ainmean&#8211; ite_na_h&#8211;Alba_~_Gaelic_Place&#8211;Names_of_Scotland\".\nGaelicplacenames.org.

    <string name="port_dundas" formatted="false"><b> Port Dundas </b>Speirs Wharf was originally the offices of the Forth &amp; Clyde Navigation Co. and the City of Glasgow Grain Mills and Stores built for John Currie &amp; Co. in 1851. The buildings were converted in 1989 into 150 loft&#8211;style residential apartments, a private leisure centre, and 19 commercial units. Port Dundas is an area of Glasgow, Scotland, located 1 mile (1.6 km) to the north of the city centre. It lies to the north of Cowcaddens, and to the west of Sighthill, with Hamiltonhill and Possilpark to the north&#8211;west. <u> Contents </u>\n* 1_History\no 1.1_Pinkston_Power_Station\no 1.2_Industrial_decline_and_regeneration\no 1.3_Port_Dundas_Grain_Distillery\n* 2_References <u> History[edit] </u> The Port Dundas terminus was established at One Hundred Acre Hill between 1786 and 1790 and was named after Sir_Lawrence_Dundas, one of the major backers of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. Port Dundas formed the terminus of a branch of the Forth_and_Clyde_Canal in the centre of Glasgow, linking to the adjacent Monkland_Canal.[1] It became an industrial centre in the 19th century, with textile mills, chemical works, granaries, distilleries, glassworks, iron foundries, power stations and engineering works all operating in the area.[1] In 1859, a brick chimney was built at Port Dundas for F. Townsend. At 454 feet (138 m) it was the tallest_chimney in the world at the time,[2] with an outside diameter of 32 feet (9.8 m) at ground level.[3] <i> Pinkston Power Station[edit] </i> In 1900, the coal fired Pinkston Power Station was built at Port Dundas to generate electricity for the Glasgow_Corporation_Tramways network. Equipped with Belliss_and_Morcom generator sets, Glasgow Corporation had decided to electrify the network by 1901 for the opening of the International Exhibition at Kelvingrove_Park. A large cooling_tower was added in 1954 and was the largest in Europe at the time.[4] After passing to the South_of_Scotland Electricity_Board in 1958, it was decommissioned in the 1960s and eventually demolished in the early 1980s. <i> Industrial decline and regeneration[edit] </i> Industry in the area declined through the 20th century. The Monkland Canal was closed to navigation in 1952, and the Forth and Clyde in 1963. Charles Tennant\'s St.Rollox Chemical Works, at one time the largest chemical manufacturer in the world closed its plant to the east of Port Dundas in 1964. The M8_motorway was constructed immediately to the south, over the route of the Monkland Canal, in the 1970s, obstructing access to the canal basin. Early in the 21st century, the Forth_and_Clyde_Canal was restored as a leisure attraction, and the canal and warehouses at Port Dundas were restored as apartments. <i> Port Dundas Grain Distillery[edit] </i> Diageo Port Dundas Grain Distillery. The area is the site of a former large Scotch Grain distillery, which produced 39 million litres of spirit each year on a 21&#8211;acre (85,000 m2) site until being closed in 2010.[5] Originally there were two distilleries in the locality, the first was established in 1811 by Daniel McFarlane. Two years later the second one was established by Brown, Gourlie &amp; Co. During 1845 Coffey_Stills for the manufacture of Grain_whisky were installed in both distilleries. Both distilleries merged in the 1860s and later became part of the Distillers Company in 1877. They were destroyed by fire in 1903 but were rebuilt and reopened in 1913, and rebuilt again in 1916 after being severely damaged by another fire. The distillery was closed for the duration of World_War_II. A large modernisation programme was undertaken during the 1970s, when a new grain intake, spirit store, still house, boiler house and dark grains plant were opened.[6] The Port Dundas Grain Distillery and adjacent Dundashill Cooperage, which manufactured Hogshead casks and dates back to 1770, are currently owned by Diageo, and the distillery\'s large Flue_gas_stack dominates the skyline of North Glasgow.[7][8] It produced Grain_whisky used in the Johnnie_Walker, J&amp;B, Bell\'s, Black_&amp;_White, Vat_69, Haig and White_Horse blended whisky brands owned by Diageo. On July 1, 2009, Diageo announced the closure of the Port Dundas distillery, with all production shifting to the company\'s other Scottish Grain distillery at Cameron_Bridge, as well as the North British Distillery in Gorgie, Edinburgh, which is jointly owned by Diageo and The Edrington_Group.[9] There are four remaining active Grain distilleries in Scotland: Invergordon Grain Distillery, owned by Whyte_and_Mackay, Strathclyde Grain Distillery in the Gorbals, owned by Pernod_Ricard, Girvan Grain Distillery, owned by William_Grant_&amp;_Sons and the Loch_Lomond_Distillery in Alexandria.[10] <u> References[edit] </u>\n1. ^ a b \"Port_Dundas\".

    <string name="zero_results" formatted="false"><b>Help</b>\nWhen searching, put a comma between each word or phrase and tap the search button.\n\n<b>Scotch whisky</b>\nScotch whisky, often simply called Scotch, is malt whisky or grain whisky made in Scotland. Scotch whisky must be made in a manner specified by law.\n\nAll Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky.\n\nAll Scotch whisky must be aged in oak barrels for at least three years. Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed&#8211;age whisky.\n\nThe first written mention of Scotch whisky is in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, 1495. A friar named John Cor was the distiller at Lindores Abbey in the Kingdom of Fife.\n\nMany Scotch whisky drinkers will refer to a unit for drinking as a dram.\n\n<b><i>Regulations and labelling</i></b>\n<b>Legal definition</b>\nAs of 23 November 2009, the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR) define and regulate the production, labelling, packaging as well as the advertising of Scotch whisky in the United Kingdom. They replace previous regulations that focused solely on production. International trade agreements have the effect of making some provisions of the SWR apply in various other countries as well as in the UK. The SWR define \"Scotch whisky\" as whisky that is:\n\nProduced at a distillery in Scotland from water and malted barley (to which only whole grains of other cereals may be added) all of which have been:\nProcessed at that distillery into a mash\nConverted at that distillery to a fermentable substrate only by endogenous enzyme systems\nFermented at that distillery only by adding yeast\nDistilled at an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 94.8% (190 US proof)\nWholly matured in an excise warehouse in Scotland in oak casks of a capacity not exceeding 700 litres (185 US gal; 154 imp gal) for at least three years\nRetaining the colour, aroma, and taste of the raw materials used in, and the method of, its production and maturation\nContaining no added substances, other than water and plain (E150A) caramel colouring\nComprising a minimum alcoholic strength by volume of 40% (80 US proof)\n\n<b>Labelling</b>\nA Scotch whisky label comprises several elements that indicate aspects of production, age, bottling, and ownership. Some of these elements are regulated by the SWR, and some reflect tradition and marketing. The spelling of the term \"whisky\" is often debated by journalists and consumers. Scottish, Australian and Canadian whiskies use \"whisky\", Irish whiskies use \"whiskey\", while American and other styles vary in their spelling of the term.\n\nThe label always features a declaration of the malt or grain whiskies used. A single malt Scotch whisky is one that is entirely produced from malt in one distillery. One may also encounter the term \"single cask\", signifying the bottling comes entirely from one cask. The term \"blended malt\" signifies that single malt whisky from different distilleries are blended in the bottle. The Cardhu distillery also began using the term \"pure malt\" for the same purpose, causing a controversy in the process over clarity in labelling – the Glenfiddich distillery was using the term to describe some single malt bottlings. As a result, the Scotch Whisky Association declared that a mixture of single malt whiskies must be labelled a \"blended malt\". The use of the former terms \"vatted malt\" and \"pure malt\" is prohibited. The term \"blended malt\" is still debated, as some bottlers maintain that consumers confuse the term with \"blended Scotch whisky\", which contains some proportion of grain whisky.\n\nThe brand name featured on the label is usually the same as the distillery name (for example, the Talisker Distillery labels its whiskies with the Talisker name). Indeed, the SWR prohibit bottlers from using a distillery name when the whisky was not made there. A bottler name may also be listed, sometimes independent of the distillery. In addition to requiring that Scotch whisky be distilled in Scotland, the SWR require that it also be bottled and labeled in Scotland. Labels may also indicate the region of the distillery (for example, Islay or Speyside).\n\nAlcoholic strength is expressed on the label with \"Alcohol By Volume\" (\"ABV\") or sometimes simply \"Vol\". Typically, bottled whisky is between 40% and 46% ABV. Whisky is considerably stronger when first emerging from the cask—normally 60–63% ABV. Water is then added to create the desired bottling strength. If the whisky is not diluted before bottling, it can be labelled as cask strength.\n\nA whisky\'s age may be listed on the bottle providing a guarantee of the youngest whisky used. An age statement on the bottle, in the form of a number, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky. Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old. In the early 21st century, such \"No age statement\" whiskies became more common, as distilleries responded to the depletion of aged stocks caused by improved sales.  A label may carry a distillation date or a bottling date. Whisky does not mature once bottled, so if no age statement is provided, one may calculate the age of the whisky if both the distillation date and bottling date are given.\n\nLabels may also carry various declarations of filtration techniques or final maturation processes. A Scotch whisky labelled as \"natural\" or \"non&#8211;chill&#8211;filtered\" has not been through a filtration process during bottling that removes compounds that some consumers see as desirable. Some whiskies are placed in different casks—often sherry or port casks—during a portion of maturation. Since this takes place at the end of the maturation process, these whiskies may be labelled as \"wood finished\", \"sherry/port finished\", and so on.\n<b>Types</b>\nThere are two basic types of Scotch whisky, from which all blends are made:\n\nSingle malt Scotch whisky means a Scotch whisky produced from only water and malted barley at a single distillery by batch distillation in pot stills.\nSingle grain Scotch whisky means a Scotch whisky distilled at a single distillery but, in addition to water and malted barley, may involve whole grains of other malted or unmalted cereals. \"Single grain\" does not mean that only a single type of grain was used to produce the whisky—rather, the adjective \"single\" refers only to the use of a single distillery (and making a \"single grain\" requires using a mixture of grains, as barley is a type of grain and some malted barley must be used in all Scotch whisky).\nExcluded from the definition of “single grain Scotch whisky” is any spirit that qualifies as a single malt Scotch whisky or as a blended Scotch whisky. The latter exclusion is to ensure that a blended Scotch whisky produced from single malt(s) and single grain(s) distilled at the same distillery does not also qualify as single grain Scotch whisky.\n\nThree types of blends are defined for Scotch whisky:\n\nBlended malt Scotch whisky means a blend of two or more single malt Scotch whiskies from different distilleries.\nBlended grain Scotch whisky means a blend of two or more single grain Scotch whiskies from different distilleries.\nBlended Scotch whisky means a blend of one or more single malt Scotch whiskies with one or more single grain Scotch whiskies.\nThe five Scotch whisky definitions are structured in such a way that the categories are mutually exclusive. The 2009 regulations changed the formal definition of blended Scotch whisky to achieve this result, but in a way that reflected traditional and current practice: before the 2009 SWR, any combination of Scotch whiskies qualified as a blended Scotch whisky, including for example a blend of single malt Scotch whiskies.\n\nAs was the case under the Scotch Whisky Act 1988, regulation 5 of the SWR 2009 stipulates that the only whisky that may be manufactured in Scotland is Scotch whisky. The definition of manufacture is \"keeping for the purpose of maturation; and keeping, or using, for the purpose of blending, except for domestic blending for domestic consumption.\" This provision prevents the existence of two ‘grades’ of whisky originating from Scotland, one “Scotch whisky” and the other, a “whisky – product of Scotland” that complies with the generic EU standard for whisky. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, allowing non&#8211;Scotch whisky production in Scotland would make it difficult to protect Scotch whisky as a distinctive product.\n<b>Single grain</b>\nThe majority of grain whisky produced in Scotland goes to make blended Scotch whisky. The average blended whisky is 60%–85% grain whisky. Some higher&#8211;quality grain whisky from a single distillery is bottled as single grain whisky.\n<b>Blended malt</b>\nBlended malt whisky—formerly called vatted malt or pure malt (terms that are now prohibited in the SWR 2009)—is one of the least common types of Scotch: a blend of single malts from more than one distillery (possibly with differing ages). Blended malts contain only malt whiskies—no grain whiskies—and are usually distinguished from other types of whisky by the absence of the word \'single\' before \'malt\' on the bottle, and the absence of a distillery name. The age of the vat is that of the youngest of the original ingredients. For example, a blended malt marked \"8 years old\" may include older whiskies, with the youngest constituent being eight years old. Johnnie Walker Green Label and Monkey Shoulder are examples of blended malt whisky. Starting from November 2011 no Scotch whisky could be labelled as a vatted malt or pure malt, the SWR requiring them to be labelled blended malt instead.\n<b>Blended</b>\nBlended Scotch whisky constitutes about 90% of the whisky produced in Scotland. Blended Scotch whiskies contain both malt whisky and grain whisky. Producers combine the various malts and grain whiskies to produce a consistent brand style. Notable blended Scotch whisky brands include Bells, Dewar\'s, Johnnie Walker, Whyte and Mackay, Cutty Sark, J and B, The Famous Grouse, Ballantine\'s and Chivas Regal.\n<b>Independent bottlers</b>\nMost malt distilleries sell a significant amount of whisky by the cask for blending, and sometimes to private buyers as well. Whisky from such casks is sometimes bottled as a single malt by independent bottling firms such as Duncan Taylor, Master of Malt, Gordon and MacPhail, Cadenhead\'s, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society, Murray McDavid, Berry Brothers and Rudd, Douglas Laing, and others. These are usually labelled with the distillery\'s name, but not using the distillery\'s trademarked logos or typefaces. An \"official bottling\" (or \"proprietary bottling\"), by comparison, is from the distillery (or its owner). Many independent bottlings are from single casks, and they may sometimes be very different from an official bottling.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, some independent brands do not identify which facility distilled the whisky in the bottle. They may instead identify only the general geographical area of the source, or they simply market the product using their own brand name without identifying their source. This may, in some cases, be simply to give the independent bottling company the flexibility to purchase from multiple distillers without changing their labels.\n<b>History</b>\n<i>To Friar John Cor, by order of the King, to make aqua vitae, VIII bolls of malt.</i>\n<u>Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, 1 June 1495.</u>\nAccording to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch whisky evolved from a Scottish drink called uisge beatha, which means \"lively water\" or \"water of life\". The earliest record of distillation in Scotland occurred as long ago as 1494, as documented in the Exchequer Rolls, which were records of royal income and expenditure. The quote above records eight bolls of malt given to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aqua vitae over the previous year. This would be enough for 1,500 bottles, which suggests that distillation was well&#8211;established by the late 15th century.\n\nWhisky production was first taxed in 1644, causing a rise in illicit whisky distilling in the country. Around 1780, there were about eight legal distilleries and 400 illegal ones. In 1823, Parliament eased restrictions on licensed distilleries with the \"Excise Act\", while at the same time making it harder for the illegal stills to operate, thereby ushering in the modern era of Scotch production. Two events helped to increase whisky\'s popularity: first, the introduction in 1831 of the column still; the whisky produced with this process was generally less expensive to produce and also less intense and smoother, because a column still can perform the equivalent of multiple distillation steps in a continuous distillation process. Second, the phylloxera bug destroyed wine and cognac production in France in 1880.\n<b>Regions</b>\nScotland was traditionally divided into four regions: The Highlands, Lowland, Islay, and Campbeltown.\n\nSpeyside, encompassing the Spey river valley in north&#8211;east Scotland, once considered part of the Highlands, has almost half of the total number (approx. 105 as of 2013) of distilleries in Scotland within its geographic boundaries; consequently it is officially recognized as a distinct region.\n\nThe Islands is not recognised as a region by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) and is considered part of the Highlands region.\n\nLowland: only three distilleries remain in operation: Auchentoshan, Bladnoch, and Glenkinchie, plus one more—Daftmill—that is currently pending its first release.\nSpeyside: has the largest number of distilleries, which includes: Aberlour, Balvenie, Cardhu, Cragganmore, Glenfarclas, Glenglassaugh, Glenfiddich, Speyburn, The Macallan, The Glenlivet, and The Glenrothes.\nHighland: some Highland distilleries: Aberfeldy, Balblair, Ben Nevis, Dalmore, Dalwhinnie, Glen Ord, Glenmorangie, Oban, and Old Pulteney.\nThe Islands, an unrecognised sub&#8211;region includes all of the whisky&#8211;producing islands (but excludes Islay): Arran, Jura, Mull, Orkney, and Skye: with their respective distilleries: Arran, Jura, Tobermory, Highland Park and Scapa, and Talisker.\nCampbeltown, once home to over 30 distilleries, currently has only three distilleries operating: Glen Scotia, Glengyle, and Springbank.\nIslay /ˈaɪlə/: has eight producing distilleries: Ardbeg, Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila, Kilchoman, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig.\nAlthough only five regions are specifically described, any Scottish locale may be used to describe a whisky if it is distilled entirely within that place; for example a single malt whisky distilled on Orkney could be described as Orkney Single Malt Scotch Whisky instead of as a Highland whisky.\n<b>References</b>\na b c d e Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009.\nMacLean 2010, p. 10.\na b c d e Scotch Whisky Association 2009.\nBender 2005, p. 556.\n\"Lindores Abbey – The Home of Scotch Whisky\". 1 October 2011.\nSimpson, John A.; Weiner, Edmund S.C., eds.
